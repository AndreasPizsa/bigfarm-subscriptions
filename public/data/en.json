  "CoopSmugglerYarn001_copy": "My, have I got quite the yarn to spin for you! It’s a tale of romance, betrayal, family, and friendship that took place on this here very farm. I’m sure an experienced farmer like you will recognize many of the places and faces I’m about to share. So sit back and relax, and remember: sometimes the truth is even stranger than fiction!\n\nI may be just an old-timer now, but back in my day, I was quite the handsome young swashbuckler with dreams of adventure and grandeur. My twin brother Barnacle and I would navigate the perils of the seven seas from atop our favorite treehouse. You could see everything from up there — even the leviathan of a greenhouse that I live in now! But I loved watching the hustle and bustle of the market most of all.\n\nThings were simpler back then. You could get some fresh popcorn at the market and go on a ride at the county fair for less than a dollar. If I wanted to write a text message, I used my typewriter, and tweets only came from birds! But as they say, the times they are a changin’. Just look at how tremendously our little village has grown since then!\n\nIt’s important that we preserve our local traditions, and the market is surely one of them. Did I tell you that I met the love of my life there? That’s right, even an old salty dog like me has a soft spot for beauty. You should have seen her, with her curly red hair cascading down her shoulders and her green eyes glittering like the aurora borealis on a moonless night, beckoning me to safe harbor. Her stunning beauty may have left me immediately smitten, but it was her famous almond muffins that stole my heart for all eternity.",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn001_title": "Big Beginnings",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn002_copy": "Aye, I’m sure a clever farmer like you already knows who my mysterious sweetheart must be. That’s right, it’s the marvelous Matilda MacMuffin! I can still remember the first time our eyes locked: a jolt akin to a jellyfish sting passed right through me! For weeks, I tried to work up the courage to tell her how I felt. Every day, I swore that I would ask for her number, but the only thing I could ever bring myself to ask for was another almond muffin! I tell you, I was as round as a muffin myself by the end of that summer!\n\nAfter months of patiently suffering my lovestruck antics, Matilda simply took it upon herself to ask if I’d like to join her for a walk along the harbor. At the end of our first date, I bought and released 100 heart balloons into the air for her. Rumor has it that you can still find a few floating around from time to time…\n\nWe may have been on cloud nine, but there was a dark cloud on the horizon, too. As the town matriarch, Margaret Cooper took it upon herself to get involved in everyone’s business, especially her daughter’s. She loved Matilda and wanted only the best for her — unfortunately, “the best” meant aspiring doctors and bankers, not a simple sailor like me.\n\nMargaret forbade Matilda from seeing me, but of course you can’t cage up two young lovebirds for long. Matilda and I began to sneak away from home for midnight rendezvous in the farthest corners of the farm: the lighthouse, under the bridge, even in a swan paddle boat on the pond! Thanks to the help of our good friend George, our romance remained a secret.\n\nBut all good things must come to an end. I wasn’t the only one completely enraptured by Matilda, of course. That ill-tempered Lester Crowley also had an eye on her — and her mother’s fortune. As George’s neighbor, it didn’t take him long to sniff out George’s new preoccupation with envelopes and the post office. One day, he snatched up an envelope that George had forgotten on his front porch and ran home to concoct a wicked plan.\n\nThat night, Matilda and I met at the airport for a romantic picnic under the stars. As I leaned in to kiss her hello, we heard a menacing voice from the bushes.\n\n“You’re in BIG trouble now, you know. I bet Margaret Cooper would love to hear about this!” A dark shape emerged from the shadows.\n\nI recognized the slouched silhouette at once.\n\n“What do you want, Lester?” I tried to keep my voice calm, but inside I knew that our perfect world was only hanging on by a thread, and Lester held the scissors.\n\n“All I want is to see you happy!” He snickered. “Unfortunately, I can be known to run my mouth at times. Perhaps there is a way you could keep me occupied, however...”\n\n“Anything! We’ll do anything!” Matilda cried.\n\nLester grinned from ear to ear. “Then help me destroy George’s farm,” he said.\n\nI looked over at my darling Matilda, her lovely eyes wide with shock. Could I betray my best friend for the woman of my dreams?",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn002_title": "Forbidden Love",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn003_copy": "At that moment, I faced the biggest decision of my life: lose the woman I love or betray my closest and dearest friend. Matilda was my wild rose in a field of thorns, but George was my lighthouse in the storm. I couldn’t imagine life without both of them by my side.\n\nMatilda clasped my hand in hers. “We can’t destroy George’s farm,” she insisted. But the tears in her eyes told a different story. I couldn’t bare to see her suffer like this.\n\n“No, it’s the only way, darling.” I wrapped my arms around her tightly. “I can’t imagine a life away from you.”\n\nShe sighed deeply. “All's fair in love and war.”\n\nThe next night, we waited for Lester outside of George’s farm as agreed. Matilda sat by the fence with her face cupped in her hands while I paced like an animal in a cage. I hadn’t slept a wink the night before and just wanted to get it over with. Suddenly, a small, chirpy voice piped up behind us.\n\n“What are you two doing here?” A freckled, orange-haired girl in a canary yellow sweater peered at us through the fence, clutching a blue notebook tightly in her fist.\n\nMatilda jumped with fright. “Rita!” She shouted. “What on earth are you doing out this late at night?”\n\n“I heard footsteps and just had to know what’s going on! I need a juicy story for my newspaper. So spill the beans!” Rita sat with her pen poised above her notebook, ready to reveal our secret to the world.\n\n“We’re just ...uh… looking at the ...um… stars,” I scrambled for words.\n\nRita scribbled furiously. “On George’s farm?”\n\n“Yes,” Matilda chimed in. “He has the best view.”\n\n“Oh!” Rita exclaimed. “My readers would just love to know that. I’d better get home and start writing!”\n\nMatilda and I shared a look of panic. Suddenly, it hit me what we were doing out here. How could we have ever considered hurting our best friend, the one who had made our romance possible in the first place?\n\n“This isn’t right,” I said. “I have to go.”\n\n“Yes!” she grabbed my hand. “I’m coming with you.”\n\n“No, darling,” I pulled my hand out of hers. “I mean I have to go. Far away. Alone. Look at what I’ve become: I was only one second away from betraying my best friend!”\n\n“No, you can’t!” Matilda pleaded. “I need you here — the town needs you here!”\n\n“Not if I’m going to destroy it! You would all be better off without me. I’ll set sail at first light.” I choked back tears and walked away.\n\nShe ran after me, tears streaming down her flushed cheeks. “Just one last night,” she pleaded breathlessly.\n\nI took her in my arms and kissed her hard. “I love you so much, Matilda.” I sat with her on the meadow of flowers below, losing myself in her arms as the sweet scent of lavender washed over us. But tomorrow always comes too soon. As the first rays of dawn broke across the purple sky, I freed myself from Matilda’s sleeping embrace and slipped away to the harbor.\n\nThat day, we parted ways believing we would never see each other again, but life always has a funny way of surprising you...",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn003_title": "A Dangerous Dilemma",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn004_copy": "Leaving Matilda was the hardest thing I had ever done in my life. I sailed from port to port, trying to forget our time together, but the memories always followed in my wake. At night, I would lie in my hammock and stare at the blanket of stars above. For me, each star represented a certain memory I shared with my Matilda. There was us running through a field of goldflowers, carving our initials into the cooperative tree, or watching the sun set a crimson gold over the navy blue waters. I imagined her looking up at the same sky and reliving the same memories, and in that moment, I knew that even if our bodies could not be together, nothing would keep our hearts apart.\n\nWanting only to be alone and forget my heartbreak, I built a little hut on a remote island where no one could find me — save for a few pesky lemurs. Several years later, to my great surprise, a passing supply airplane attached a stained, yellowing envelope to my daily copy of the Racing Farmer. The letter was from none other than Steve Screwdriver, Matilda’s younger brother! I tore it open at once, terrified of what I would find, but also desperate to receive any news on my long lost sweetheart.\n\nWhat I read left me in such a state of shock that you could have knocked me over with a peacock feather:\n\nDear Yarnacle,\n\nI’m afraid I got some awful news. Matilda had a bad accident in the garage and is in a coma now! The doctors said her prospects don’t look so good.\n\nAnd that ain’t the only thing I have to tell you: after the accident, I discovered something very strange. I was feeling blue, so I went for a walk into the mine and stumbled upon a pile of your old stuff! Suddenly I heard footsteps and ducked behind a rock. Can you guess who I saw then? You! Or so I thought … \n\nI asked what in the world you were doing there, and you got this guilty look on your face and confessed everything. It wasn’t “you” at all, but rather your twin brother, Barnacle, who has been pretending to be you, Yarnacle, for all these years!\n\nI can only imagine the reason Barnacle is dressing as you is so he can help care for your little daughter, Eva. You should really see her: her cheeks are rosier than the reddest apples.\n\nPlease come home to set the story straight and see Matilda before it’s too late!\n\nBest,\nSteve\n\nMy head began to swim and I collapsed onto my cot. What a triple whammy to my senses! A million thoughts raced through my head like the winds of a sea storm. I have a daughter? Barnacle is dressing as me? Will I ever see my precious Matilda alive again? But out of all those tumultuous thoughts, one feeling rose above the chaos of my mind to where my thinking was calm and clear: I must go home. I must see Big Farm again.",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn004_title": "Shocking Secrets",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn005_copy": "My ship whipped across the waves like a wild wind! Finally, I was going home! But no matter how fast I raced across the seas, my heart always raced faster. I longed to catch that first glimpse of the lighthouse in the fog, to step off the pier and onto the soft grass below, and to smell the spicy and delectable aromas of the market. But most of all, I couldn’t wait to see Matilda and my daughter, Eva, and set the story straight with Barnacle! \n\nDark clouds began to roll in over the farm as I anchored my ship and rowed my dinghy to the pier. Goosebumps popped up along my arms as the electricity in the air began to rise. I knew a real devil of a storm could break loose at any moment … and I would be caught in the middle of it.\n\nI hoisted myself onto the dock, stood up, and felt like my heart would jump straight out of my chest! There I saw … myself. It was as if someone had placed a mirror in the middle of the pier, but this mirror had given my reflection an old, stiff captain's outfit and a ridiculous beard!\n\n“I knew this day would come.” The strange reflection put his arm on my shoulder.\n\nI pushed him away from me. “Barnacle! My brother, the betrayer!”\n\n“Yarnacle, listen…” Barnacle walked toward me. Thunder rumbled in the distance.\n\n“Get back, you black-hearted landlubber!” I raised my fists. “Don’t you come one step closer!”\n\nA bolt of lightning cracked over our heads and thunder echoed across the harbor. I saw a look of desperation cross Barnacle’s face as he walked toward me. “Yarnacle, you wouldn’t…”\n\nAll of a sudden, something wet plopped between our feet. A cool and slimy tentacle caressed my toes.\n\n“What the…?” Barnacle and I yelled in unison. He bent over and picked up a squirming ball of what appeared to be purple jelly. \n\n“Why, what do we have here?” He asked with a grin. A small violet octopus wrapped her tentacle around his arm and dangled from it like an expert acrobat.\n\nI couldn’t help myself: gales of laughter swept over me like a stormwind. Soon Barnacle was also clutching his belly, tears streaming down his face. Just like when we were kids. The menacing clouds finally broke open, pouring rain upon us and making us laugh even harder.\n\nOnce he had caught his breath, Barnacle turned to me with a solemn look on his face: “After Eva was born, I tried to contact you. I wrote a letter every day for a year! But I never heard back. Matilda was devastated; she was in no state to care for Eva or her new adoptive son, Johnny. Slowly, it dawned on me what I had to do — I had to be you.  Of course I felt awful about it, but I knew it was the right thing to do.” The octopus climbed her way up to his shoulder, but he didn’t even notice.\n\n“I told everyone that I was setting off on another grand adventure, anchored my ship in the nearest cove, and swam back in your old captain uniform. I told them that I...you...had gotten caught in a terrible storm and the ship had capsized. Despite all odds, you found the strength to fight the seas all the way back to your home, Big Farm.” Barnacle pushed away a curious tentacle that wanted to become friends with his beard.\n\n“You should have seen Matilda’s face — like a million rays of sunshine bursting through a storm cloud. But you can’t tell her the truth now: in her state, it could kill her!” Barnacle seized my hand. “Yarnacle, promise me you won’t tell her!”\n\nI couldn’t think, couldn’t speak, couldn’t do anything but watch this silly little octopus wiggle her way over to Barnacle’s other shoulder.\n\nMy trance was broken as the small, high-pitched voice of Rita Mercury carried across the pier: “Matilda is awake! Come back, quick!”",

  "CoopSmugglerYarn006_copy": "Matilda is awake! Every cell of my body longed to run to her side, to hold her beautiful face in my hands, to stroke that fiery hair.\n\nBarnacle caught my eye. “She can’t find out about you. The shock would kill her.” I ran past him, but he grabbed my arm firmly. “Yarnacle, promise me you won’t tell her!”\n\nI jerked my hand away but didn’t try to run further. As much as it pained me to admit, I knew he was right. I took one last look at the shore — there was the old flagpole where Matilda and I once tried to carve our initials, the bench where I told Matilda that I loved her, even that old rundown red shack where we shared our first midnight rendezvous. I turned away, blinking back tears, and slowly got back into my dinghy.\n\nI looked up at my brother, and despite the cold rain and my even colder heart, I felt the warm tides of fraternal love wash over me. “I promise I won’t tell her,” I sighed. “Take care of her, brother.” I pushed the dinghy off the dock. Goodbye, Big Farm. Goodbye, Matilda.\n\nAs the years passed, the memories began to fade, but the pain remained just as sharp. I couldn’t distract myself as I had before. This time I needed to be a part of my family’s life, even if it had to remain a secret. I contacted Steve Screwdriver and asked for his help. We concocted a tale about a lonely adventurer, Redbeard, in need of some penpals on the mainland. Steve would read Redbeard’s gripping tales of adventure to Matilda and Eva and send me their serene accounts of farm life in return. In this way, I finally got a chance to learn all about my precious little Eva and reconnect to my dear Matilda, even if she never knew it.\n\nThose years were the longest and hardest of my life. They say that time heals all wounds, but some wounds are simply too deep. I traveled to every corner of the world, trying to escape my pain, but it followed me like a dark shadow. My beard grew long and wild, and my hair would have made a fine nest for one of the many seabirds trailing my ship. Finally, I couldn’t take it anymore! I knew I had made a promise to Barnacle, but I was determined to see my family now, no matter the cost. So I threw all caution to the wind and set sail for home!\n\nI knew exactly where to go: Matilda’s new farm academy. She had told “Redbeard” all about it in her letters. I landed on shore and hid myself behind a large tree across the way from the academy. Two rambunctious youngsters shouted and laughed as they chased each other in a good-natured game of tag. Suddenly my breath caught in my throat as the school’s double doors swung open. Matilda stepped out into the sunshine, a little rounder in the middle and grayer on the top, but still as beautiful as the first time I laid eyes on her. For one moment, the world stood completely still, and I felt at peace.\n\n“Oof!” I cried as something hard and round plowed straight into my belly. One of those two youngsters, a small but wiry boy, fell flat onto his back, a shock of black hair falling straight into his eyes.\n\n“Sorry, mister!” Young Benny Buddler said. “Tessa was right behind me and I wasn’t lookin’ where I was goin’.”\n\n“I’d say so!” I laughed as I helped him back onto his feet. “You ran smack dab into me, little fella!”\n\nSuddenly Benny’s eyes flew to something behind me. “I didn’t know he was there, Miss Matilda!” he exclaimed.\n\nMy heart stopped beating. My legs turned to jelly. It took every ounce of strength in my body just to turn around and finally face my sweetheart again.\n\n“Matilda, darling, listen — ,” was all I managed before she fainted into my arms.",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn006_title": "Troubled Waters",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn007_copy": "Matilda’s eyes fluttered open. She sat up on her cot and gazed at the familiar posters and photos that adorned the farm academy wall. Finally she mustered the courage to peek at me out of the corner of her eye.\n\n“Who … who are you?” Her face was as white as if she had just seen a ghost. “I don’t understand this…”\n\n“Please relax, darling,” I stroked her hand with my thumb. “There is so much you don’t know.”\n\n“Then tell me.” She took a deep breath and locked her eyes with mine. “I’m ready.” \n\nSo I told her everything, from my first day out at sea, to the letter from Steve, to my confrontation with Barnacle the night she woke from her coma. And then I confessed how much I had missed her, how no other woman could hold a candle to her, how she was my sun and moon and everything in-between, and how I simply could not live another day without her.\n\nI was relieved to see color returning to her cheeks, but I needed to hear her voice, too.\n\n“Matilda, please understand,” I begged. “Please say something, anything!”\n\nShe paused for a long moment. “I love you,” she whispered.\n\nMeanwhile, completely unbeknownst to us, a now older but just as inquisitive Rita Mercury had crouched outside the window and was listening attentively to every word I said. She ran off to share this exciting news with her best friend, Eva, who busy training her horses at the Big Farm horse ranch. This was before the ranch belonged to Rose, of course.\n\nEva was completely floored when she heard the news. Teenage girls are said to be drawn to drama, but even this was too much for her to bear. I suppose she inherited her mother’s disposition in that regard. However, unlike her mother, Eva was not quick to forgive and forget. \n\nEnraged, Eva ran home and tossed her favorite organic jackets and polished stone jewelry into her hand-sewn cotton knapsack. Rita begged her to calm down. “This is good news!” she repeated over and over again.\n\nEva laughed at this remark and continued her packing.\n\n“At least tell me where you’re going,” Rita pleaded.\n\n“Up north!” Eva snapped. She hopped on her favorite horse, Misty, and they galloped straight for the harbor. You won’t believe the next part of this story, but I swear by Poseidon’s trident that it’s true! Eva sailed off with the only boat in the harbor — and who do you think that rusty bucket belonged to? That’s right, ol’ Yarnacle! I must admit, even though I was shocked by this stunt, I couldn’t help but be proud that my Eva was a chip off the old block!\n\nWhile all of this was happening, Matilda and I were in the farm academy, completely oblivious to the outside world. For the first time in decades, I felt my heart overflowing with love. If only I had known how fleeting this feeling could be.\n\nRita barged in the front door, out of breath and covered in a thin sheen of sweat.\n\n“Eva … north...” she gasped and frantically gestured out the window toward the turquoise sea.\n\nMatilda and I shared a quizzical look. “What’s going on, Rita?” she asked.\n\n“Eva is gone!” Rita stammered. “She … she ran away!”\n\nMatilda clutched her heart and collapsed onto the cot. I fell to my knees by her side, crying her name, but she remained completely unresponsive. I grabbed her wrist, but her pulse was only a light flutter, barely perceptible under my calloused fingers.\n\n“Rita!” I shouted. “Get the doctor immediately. Matilda’s dying!”",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn007_title": "A Divided Family",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn008_copy": "The doctor arrived at once and hurried to Matilda’s side. He placed his small stethoscope on her chest and listened carefully. The deep frown of concern that crossed his normally jolly face gave me a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach.\n\n“I’m afraid Matilda has suffered a terrible shock,” the doctor said as he clasped my hand in his own. “Her heart is very weak at the moment. If she is exposed to any more excitement or confusion, it could kill her. Is there anything you can do to put her mind at ease?”\n\nI nodded sternly. “I can fix this,” I promised him.\n\n“But you have no boat!” Rita cried.\n\n“No, but I know somebody who does.” I threw open the door. “Where is Barnacle?”\n\n“Already here, brother!” A deep, familiar voice called from around the corner. “I came as soon as I heard the news.”\n\nWhen I caught sight of that big, rust-colored beard again, every repressed emotion from the last 10 years came rushing back. There was love and compassion, yes, but that was followed by an overpowering rush of anger, and most of all, a deep feeling of betrayal. I would have rather swum in a pool of stinging jellyfish than have spent any time with my traitor brother, but I knew I had no choice. This wasn’t about me; it was about my family.\n\n“Barnacle, I have to bring Eva home. I need your ship. Will you help me?” I demanded.\n\n“Of course, brother. We will bring her home together!” He fished the boat keys out of his pocket and dropped them in my palm. “Go raise the sails. I’ll grab supplies.” \n\nThat’s just like Barnacle, I thought to myself. Always playing the hero when he’s the one who got us into this mess in the first place. My mood grew dark, almost as dark as the black clouds accumulating on the horizon.\n\nI found Barnacle’s boat without an issue — it was a spitting image of mine, but the quality couldn’t even come close. I had half a mind to hoist the sails and leave Barnacle far behind, but something made me stay put. Even if I dreaded the idea of days stranded on a boat with Barnacle, I knew that I needed his help if I wanted to get Eva back before Matilda woke up.\n\nBarnacle appeared not long after, his arms laden with milk, eggs, and boxes of exotic fruit. I helped him without a word. He returned the silence. As we raised the anchor and prepared the rigging, the tension between us grew so thick that you could have cut it with a knife. Good thing neither one of us had one!\n\nThe storm brewing in the distance only put us more on edge. We bickered about who would steer the boat first. After a few minutes of “colorful” name calling, we agreed to simply flip a friendship penny instead. Barnacle won, and I huffed and puffed my way below deck for a quick nap to help me calm my nerves.\n\nI woke to the sound of great waves crashing against the hull. The vessel twisted and lurched as massive thunder cracked above. I jumped out of my bunk and, balancing myself between the walls of the tiny berth, maneuvered my way up to deck.\n\n“Ahoy, there!” Barnacle called over the pouring rain and gusts of wind. “Too bumpy for you, landlubber?”\n\n“What, this little drizzle? I’m here to take my shift!” But just as I tried to take the helm, a great wave crashed over the ship and slammed me against the railing hard enough to rattle my teeth.\n\n“You’d better get back below deck, dear brother! This kind of weather is only for real sailors!” Barnacle’s laugh rose high above the whistling winds.\n\nThat was the last straw. I couldn’t take it anymore! Too many years of lies, secrecy, and betrayal. I felt the rage of 1000 sea storms breaking loose inside me. But just as I raised my fists, a tremendous bolt of lightning cracked through the ship’s mast, leaving only a smoking hole in its wake — a smoking hole that was now rapidly filling up with seawater.",

  "CoopSmugglerYarn009_copy": "I looked on in horror as the ice cold water encircled my ankles, slowly climbing its way up my legs.\n\n“Help me!” Barnacle shouted as he frantically tossed bucket after bucket of water overboard, oblivious to the fact that the water was already up to our knees.\n\nI grabbed Barnacle by the shoulders and shook him hard. “Brother, it’s too late! We have to get off this boat — NOW!” I yelled.\n\nBarnacle shook me off. “No! A captain always goes down with his ship. Save yourself, Yarnacle. Eva and Matilda need you!” He paused a moment and looked me in the eye. “I’m sorry for everything.”\n\nThe great ship moaned and groaned beneath the pressure of the crashing waves and rising water. I knew her seconds were numbered. I grabbed Barnacle’s arm.\n\n“No, Barnacle! Don’t apologize. I’m the one who should be sorry. You were only trying to help, and all I did was call you names and behave like a petulant child.” I dragged him with me toward the dinghy. “Please come with me! We need to do this together.” I stopped to look at him. “I love you, brother.”\n\nBarnacle grabbed my other arm and locked eyes with me. “I love you, too. I’m so sorry.” He hugged me in a tight embrace. “Come on, let’s go!”\n\nWe sloshed our way over to the thankfully still intact dinghy and scrambled in, much to the relief of Mr. and Miss Tentacle, who had plastered themselves to our shoulders in fright. As we rowed away from the sinking ship, the skies cleared and the sea calmed. Finally safe, Barnacle and I looked at each other and laughed. What a crazy mess!\n\n“What now?” I asked. “We lost everything: our map, our food, our water.”\n\n“Don’t worry,” Barnacle smiled as he rowed against the waves. “My son Johnny lives only a stone’s throw away.”\n\nI heard sand scraping at the bottom of the dinghy. We had arrived at a pristine white beach, adorned by a towering rock with a curving staircase carved into it.\n\n“Follow me!” Barnacle shouted as he pulled the dinghy onto the sand. We climbed the worn stone stairs and gazed down upon a breathtaking tropical island, lush in green palm trees and foliage. Sandy beaches lined the shore, dotted with the colorful towels and umbrellas of festive beach-goers, and a dazzling crystal clear waterfall sparkled in the sunlight.\n\n“Welcome to the island farm!” Barnacle clapped me on the shoulder. “Johnny is sure to have some extra fruit for us! Let’s go find him!”\n\nI held my breath nervously as we crossed a rickety wooden bridge and wandered down the island’s one stone path to a little farm nestled in the tropical wilderness. Along the way, I had to dodge at least two mischievous lemurs with a fervent desire to steal my hat!\n\nWe came upon a tan young man with long dreadlocks lying in a hammock next to a pretty brunette in a white doctor’s coat. Laughter and music floated over from a bustling bar not far away.\n\n“Johnny! Vicky!” Barnacle cried. “I can’t believe what you’ve done to this place. Your beach bar has really taken off, and your oranges are bigger than ever! I don’t suppose you have some to spare?”\n\n“Dad!” Johnny jumped out of his hammock and slung his guitar over his shoulder. “You finally made it out here! Have you met my girlfriend Vicky yet? She’s a vet!”\n\nVicky flashed us a beautiful smile. “You guys look thirsty! Would you like an Orange Fizz? Or how about a Summer Slush? That one really rakes in the seashells!”\n\n“Just some water for us two old salts!” Barnacle said. “We don’t have time to talk right now, Johnny. Our boat sank, and we need some supplies — not to mention a ship — so we can sail north to bring home your sister, Eva.”\n\nJohnny’s relaxed grin disappeared. “Of course! Anything to help. You can have all the oranges, coconuts, and peanuts that you want, Dad. I’ve even got a spare map! But I’m afraid I can’t help you with a boat. We need ours for when the monsoon hits. But old Oleg Fisher keeps a few extra trawlers docked here. Maybe you can ask him. Just make sure you hurry — the next monsoon is on its way, and it’ll wipe out the entire farm!”",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn009_title": "Swallowed by the Sea",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn010_copy": "Barnacle and I set out to find Oleg at once. Time was of the essence, and it was slipping through our fingers faster than the sand on the beach. We found the seasoned fisherman scrubbing the deck of his boat. The word SILVY was painted on the back in bright white letters. Only an eccentric angler like Oleg would ever name his boat after a pet fish!\n\n“Long time no see, ol’ Oleg!” Barnacle hollered up at him from the dock.\n\nOleg’s face broke into a huge grin. “Ahoy, you salty swab! What’re you doing in these parts?”\n\n“We were on our way north but lost our ship and supplies in the storm of the century! Could you lend us a hand … and maybe a boat?” Barnacle laughed.\n\n“Of course! Anything for a fellow seafarer.” Oleg fished in his pocket for a set of keys and tossed them down to us. “Silvy 2 is all patched up and ready to go — just promise me you’ll treat her like your own. I couldn’t bear to lose another Silvy!”\n\n“We will treat her like the princess she is,” Barnacle promised. We climbed aboard Silvy 2, a rusty trawler with peeling white paint, careful to dodge the many lures and lines littering the boat’s cockpit.\n\nJohnny, Vicky, and Oleg waved goodbye as we pulled out of the harbor. We were back on the open sea! Luckily, the storm hadn’t thrown us too far off course. It wasn’t long until the snowy peaks and stone lighthouse of the viking farm came into sight. Barnacle skillfully dodged the floating icebergs and navigated the dilapidated old trawler up to the pier. I breathed in the crisp, cold air, enjoying the rich fragrance of fir trees with a hint of flax and berries.\n\n“Go talk to her, Yarnacle. She needs to hear the truth from you. I’ll wait here,” Barnacle said as he tied the boat to the dock.\n\nI walked toward a snowy cottage with smoke puffing out of a small chimney nestled in its red roof. My heart was pounding so hard that I thought it would jump straight out of my chest! A strapping young fellow with long, wavy blonde hair stopped me at the gate. He took one look at me and frowned.\n\n“Eva doesn’t want to see you,” he said.\n\n“Who are you?” I countered.\n\n“Nils Nordson,” he said matter-of-factly, never breaking eye contact. “Eva’s boyfriend, and a viking-in-training.”\n\n“Nils, listen…” I hoped he would be reasonable. “I need to set things right. I need to tell Eva the truth.”\n\nNils swung a massive stone mallet onto his shoulder. I couldn’t help but notice a flicker of pain cross his face as he did. However, I knew better than to challenge a man with viking blood, even if he was in a weakened state.\n\n“Please go home,” Nils said sternly. “She’ll return when she’s ready.”\n\nOut of the corner of my eye, I spied an axe glinting in the sunlight. At that moment, the most harebrained idea crossed my mind, but it was so crazy that it just might work.\n\n“Nils, you must be quite strong to have built this farm with your own two hands!” I caught a flash of pride on his face. “I’ll tell you what: if you can chop more wood than me in one minute, I’ll go home without another word. But if I can chop more wood than you, you will let me talk to my daughter.”\n\nNils eyed me skeptically.\n\n“No trick,” I assured him. “Do you accept the challenge? Or are you scared of losing to an old man?”\n\nNils squared his shoulders, and another barely perceptible grimace of pain crossed his face. “Challenge accepted,” he said with a self-assured smile.",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn010_title": "Call of the North",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn011_copy": "I followed Nils to a grove of freshly felled firs — some of the trunks were as thick as the strange rocks I had seen in the stone circle on the shore! Nils handed me the axe.\n\nI struggled to lift the heavy beast. All that time on tropical islands had left me a bit lacking in physical strength, but if my hunch was correct, I wouldn’t have to even break a sweat today.\n\nNils waited to lift his own axe. “Guests first,” he offered and gestured toward a massive log balanced atop a stump.\n\n“No, no. Let’s do it together. That’s only fair,” I replied as I watched him out of the corner of my eye. “On the count of three: 1...2…”\n\n“Wait!” Nils interrupted. “This is ridiculous. An old man like you could strain his back doing something like this!”\n\nI smiled to myself. Just as I had expected: despite his strong exterior, Nils had a weak back.\n\n“It’s clear to me now how much you love Eva,” Nils continued. “I’ll talk to her on your behalf.”\n\n“Thanks so much, Nils. I knew I could count on you,” I patted him lightly on the shoulder.\n\nNils returned shortly with a scowling Eva in tow. She avoided my gaze by pretending to focus on the noisy penguin pool instead.\n\n“Eva,” I caught her eye for a brief second. “We’ve been caught in this web of lies for too long now. I’m going to tell you the truth, and I don’t expect you to forgive me, but I do hope that you will at least understand.” I sat down on a sturdy-looking stump. I motioned for her to do the same. “This might take a while.”\n\nAnd then I told her the whole story, front to back and straight through the middle. Tears welled up in Eva’s eyes when I got to the part about Matilda’s ill health. When I finished, she wiped her eyes and stood up.\n\n“Family comes first,” she said. “Nils, pack our bags. We’re going home!” She hugged me tightly and I felt my heart swell with joy.\n\nNils looked uncomfortable. “Eva, you know I can’t leave the farm. My viking tunic business is finally taking off!”\n\n“But I need you!” Another tear rolled down Eva’s cheek. “You can use your knowledge of ancient Viking herbs to help my mom. Omar can look after the farm for us!”\n\n“Who is Omar?” I asked.\n\n“He’s the oriental salesman who trades special products for the farm,” Nils explained. “You probably saw his boat in the harbor when you arrived. But there’s just one problem: Omar always has a price, and we have nothing left that he would want. Omar prefers exotic goods.” Nils frowned and stroked his beard. “What will we do?”\n\n“You’re in luck!” I laughed. “It just so happens that Barnacle and I just paid a visit to Johnny’s island farm.” I pulled one of the coconuts out of my coat pocket. “We haven’t got much, but maybe we can strike some sort of deal.”\n\nWhile the youngsters packed up their things, I returned to the harbor, where I found Barnacle and Omar in the middle of a heated game of checkers.\n\n“King me!” Barnacle shouted as he smacked the table proudly.\n\nThis gave me a terrific idea. I whispered something in Barnacle’s ear.\n\n“Why don’t we raise the stakes, my friend?” Barnacle proposed.\n\n“I’m listening…” said Omar.\n\n“If you win, you can have my trawler over there.” Barnacle gestured toward the boat, and Omar’s mouth dropped in surprise. “But if I win, you will watch the farm while Eva and Nils take a little vacation.”\n\nOmar couldn’t pass up an offer like that. He agreed without a moment’s hesitation — and without looking down at the checkerboard first.\n\nIn his next move, Barnacle jumped Omar’s last four pieces in one fell swoop.\n\nOmar stared at the board with wide, bewildered eyes. Suddenly he burst into laughter. “Well played, my friend! Good game indeed.”\n\nAt that moment, Eva and Nils ran up with their bags, their breath condensing in the frosty air.\n\n“Can you help us, Omar?” Eva panted. “We have no time to spare!”\n\n“Of course, young lady!” He smiled and patted her shoulder. “Omar is a man of his word.”\n\nWe piled onto Silvy 2, the old lass groaning under our combined weight. Despite her age, she flew like the wind as we left the harbor. I felt the first spark of hope that we would surely beat this race against time and save Matilda. But as fate would have it, my hopes were sent plummeting deep into the sea once more: my map was missing…",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn011_title": "Homeward Bound",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn012_copy": "I turned the little boat upside down in a frantic search for the missing map. Without it, we could be lost at sea for months. Barnacle, Eva, and Nils helped me look, but luck was not on our side. As dusk settled in, I finally spied a tiny slip of paper clinging stubbornly to the bottom of a small, purple tentacle.\n\n“Miss Tentacle!” I shouted and grabbed for the paper. She quickly popped it into her mouth.\n\n“She must have eaten the entire thing!” Barnacle picked her up and flipped her over, desperate to find any last traces of the map stuck to her feelers. She wriggled out of his hands and scooted across the deck.\n\n“What are we going to do now?” Eva burst into tears. Nils put an arm around her and tried to comfort her.\n\n“We’ll figure something out,” he said reassuringly. “Whether it’s reenacting the lives of our ancestors or saving endangered animals, we always find a way.”\n\nEva smiled up at him through her tears. All of a sudden she jumped to her feet.\n\n“What are those strange lights?” She peered into the darkness. “They’re so bright. They must be coming from land!”\n\nBarnacle set course for this ring of blinking lights, which appeared to be hovering in mid-air. They guided us through the night and early into the next morning. I must have dozed off because the next thing I remember is being jerked awake by a loud cry of “Land ahoy!”\n\nI couldn’t believe my eyes: we were back! You couldn’t mistake the rusty old fishing pole, the light at the end of the pier, and my favorite: the odor of fresh dung! Nils, Eva, Barnacle, and I hugged each other in joy.\n\nWe set off to the farm academy as fast as our legs would carry us, Eva leading the way. She burst through the front doors of the academy. “Mom!” she shouted and ran over to Matilda’s cot. “Mom, wake up!”\n\nMatilda’s pale face shone like the moon in the weak dawn light. Her eyes were closed - I prayed that she was only asleep.\n\nMatilda’s eyelids slowly fluttered open, and she saw Eva kneeling beside her. “My darling daughter,” she whispered weakly. “You’re okay!”\n\n“I’m sorry I left, Mom. And look! I met Yarnacle … er, Dad.” A look of uncertainty crossed Eva’s face and she looked at Barnacle and me.\n\n“Matilda,” Barnacle stepped forward. “I’m so sorry for everything I did. I wanted to help, but in the end, I just made everything worse.” Barnacle stared at his hands. “How could you ever forgive me?”\n\n“Sweet Barnacle,” Matilda motioned for him to come closer. “Of course I forgive you. Family always comes first — and you did right by this one.” She grasped his hand in her own. “You will always belong here.”\n\nShe looked at me next and smiled. “I knew you would come back for me, Yarnacle.” She raised her arms. “Help me up, darling. I feel better already.” I lifted her into a sitting position and straightened her pillow behind her.\n\n“I’ll never leave your side again,” I promised. I turned to Barnacle. “Brother, take my ship. It’s your turn to see the world!”\n\nHis face broke into a wide grin and he clapped me on the back.\n\nWe were so busy celebrating Matilda’s returning health and our hopes for a better future that we didn’t notice Nils and Eva slip away. He took her hand and led her to the cooperative tree, the place where he first saw her weaving a homemade cotton bracelet.\n\nNils traced his finger over the spot where they had carved their initials into the bark. He pulled Eva close to him. “Eva, I couldn’t bear the thought of another moment without you. You are the woman who has made me into the man I am today. I love everything about you, and I want to live every day of this beautiful life with you by my side.” He bent down on one knee. “Will you marry me?”\n\nEva’s hands flew to her heart and tears sprang to her eyes. She pulled Nils back to his feet. “Of course! Of course!” she exclaimed and pulled him in for a big kiss.\n\nThose two had the most beautiful wedding Big Farm has ever seen. Millions of turquoise ribbons streamed down the walls of the library, pooling at the bottom like a serenity pond. The fountain was home to a dozen koi fish swimming and splashing playfully. Roses and violet blossoms lined every path and balcony, their rich fragrances wafting through the air.\n\nBarnacle and I were given the privilege of escorting Eva down the aisle, and she was the most beautiful blushing bride I have ever laid eyes on. But the best part of the night was after the ceremony, when Matilda and I snuck over to the wedding altar, just the two of us.\n\nI took her hands in mine and looked into her brilliant green eyes. “Matilda,” I whispered, my throat tight with emotion. “I promise to love you forever — for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do us part.” I leaned in and kissed her tenderly on the lips. “You will always be my darling.”\n\nAnd I’ve kept that promise ever since, dear reader. Doubt the facts of my story if you will, but if there is anything that always was true and always will be true, it’s that my love is real — my love for Eva, my love for Matilda, and most of all my love for this beautiful town, Big Farm.",

  "CoopSmugglerYarn101_copy": "Even though ol’ Oleg is by no means new to the Big Farm community, many farmers first met him only recently when he opened up his own fishing &amp; restaurant business. It’s definitely worth paying him a visit. He knows how to catch every fish under the sun — and sea!\n\nOleg learned everything he knows from his loving father, Oliver. Back when Big Farm barely covered two blocks, Oliver owned a small fishery near the shore. Oliver always dreamed that Oleg would follow in his footsteps and take over the family business one day. Little Oleg loved fishing and practiced daily with his pet goldfish, Silvy, but his heart yearned for adventure, and he didn’t want to be tied down by the responsibility of the fishery. One day, he ran away from home and set sail for deep waters to test his luck at catching the “reel” big fish.\n\nMany years later, Oleg received a letter from his friend Omar informing him that his father had died and that the fishery had been demolished. Suddenly Oleg regretted his many years out at sea and raced home as fast as his trawler Silvy would carry him. On the way, it dawned on him that there was only one way to ease his guilt: open a new fishery in his father’s honor.\n\nUnfortunately, Oleg’s fondness for returning his finned friends back to the sea had left him with no money for opening a fishery. All he had was his old boat and the fishing gear his father had given him when he was young. So Oleg decided to finally buckle down and turn his skills into profit, even if it meant saying goodbye to some of his underwater pets. Now he is well on his way to earning enough cash to open his own fishery — and the idea has got him completely hooked!",

And what could be more pure and natural than the days before computers, telephones — even electricity? Once upon a time, real vikings inhabited viking island, a small islet not far north of here. Unfortunately, the ice bridge connecting the island to the mainland often melted, which made it difficult to live there permanently and ultimately forced the vikings to emigrate to the Big Farm mainland, where they were among the first settlers to cultivate the fertile land.\n\nThe island remained deserted for many centuries, until a young Nils Nordson came up with a clever business idea: produce authentic viking goods and garb and market them to a modern audience with a desire to reconnect to its past. From rustic viking tankards full of mead to cozy viking coats, Nils knows how to meet the needs of his sophisticated consumers using all-natural, homegrown materials.\n\nNils is concerned with more than profit, however. He also cares deeply about the environment and making the world a better place for future generations. The viking farm boasts numerous pools and pens where Nils and his helpers raise endangered penguins and seals to release back into the wild. While some may find it strange to see penguins at the “north” pole, spend enough time around here and you’ll soon realize that the world map compass has a logic all of its own!",

At Tundra University, he studied the lives and cultures of the first viking clans. With his degree in Vikingology nestled securely under his belt, he jumped into his longship and set sail to the old viking island. There he wanted to prove once and for all that he could recreate the lives of the vikings for himself - and even make a profit while he was at it.\n\nUnfortunately, Nils forgot to take the ice storms into account, and he lost everything after only 30 days. But did that slow him down? Of course not! He simply saved his snow dollars and started rebuilding as soon as the ice had melted.\n\nAll of this building and rebuilding has taken its toll on Nils’ back, however. He can’t even lift his mallet without feeling pain now. I’m sure some rest would help, but Nils is the type who never takes a break. If he’s not out in the fields harvesting flax or up at the North Cape studying the mating habits of polar bears, you can find him picking apples with his wife Eva.

Omar wanted to reach the viking farm before the monsoon hit, and he was making great speed thanks to the strong wind at his back. Oleg was also taking advantage of the windy weather: the great waves stirred up the water, causing the fish to jump practically straight into his boat. But the more fish he caught, the more he wanted, and soon he was leaning over the railing, holding up his net like a parachute for the fish to jump into. Suddenly, a great, rolling wave tipped the boat and sent Oleg plunging headfirst into the treacherous waters.\n\nOmar heard Oleg’s cries for help and sailed over as fast as he could. He dived into the choppy water — an especially agile swimmer for his age and girth — and pulled Oleg back onto his fishing boat. Oleg was so grateful that he gave Omar all of his catch for the day, and the two have been best mates ever since.\n\nOleg is all that Omar has now.

The funny thing is that the islanders don’t even like fruit! They collect it because there’s a special sea breeze there that keeps the fruit fresh and ripe for days and infuses it with a fantastic flavor! The islanders then trade this fruit for what they really want, farm products, and I’m just the man for that. \n\nDon’t get me wrong! Barnacle is a good salesman, but he’s a bit slow on the seas.

Matilda saw their struggle and offered to raise Johnny as one of her own. He’s been a part of the family ever since, even if he does sometimes tease Eva until her face is the color of a red delicious!\n\nJohnny has to travel a lot these days to manage all his businesses. Thankfully, he’s not alone! He met the apple to his pie not long ago when she flew to the island farm to help Johnny with a pesky lemur problem.

In fact, all she wanted to do was crawl into a hole and pull it in after her. Everywhere she went, the new nickname “Rattlebrained Rita” followed her.\n\nDesperate to feel normal again, Rita returned to the only place she knew where no one owned a television set: Big Farm. The Racing Farmer was glad to have her back and exactly as she had left it, perhaps just a bit dustier. It only took her one day to collect all the news she had missed over the past few months and publish it! To be fair, this news only included a report on the latest crop circles and some photos of painted eggs from the craft workshop at the preschool, but it was good to know nonetheless! Rita was thrilled to be in her element again, and we were pleased as punch to have her back!\n\nEven if country-living isn’t as fast-paced and exciting as big city life, Rita can always make a mountain out of a molehill for her articles.

She tends to the education of her pupils just as lovingly as she tends to her mushrooms, ensuring that they always grow and thrive.\n\nYou wouldn’t believe how many bright young farmers out there are eager to gain experience in this important industry! Matilda’s investment has definitely paid off: not only is the school open to everyone in town, but it’s also got a bright future ahead of it thanks to generous donors like you!",

He throws himself into every task headfirst and isn’t afraid to tackle new challenges. Benny isn’t the type to come up with new ideas himself, however. Even though he’s handy with tools, he’s not the sharpest tool in the shed when it comes to innovation. Nonetheless, everyone on the farm loves him — especially the ladies, if all the scuttlebutt around here is true!\n\nBenny’s father was a salesman and taught Benny to always show his best side. Benny applied this to his work but never aspired to join his father in the 9 to 5 grind. He loves the great outdoors and could never stomach a boring office job. He was one of Matilda’s most diligent and attentive students at the farm academy and visits her on a regular basis to help her with her garden. His Hawaiian cousin, Lana, has also been known to visit the farm from time-to-time to add a touch of Hawaiian flair, make some delicious ice cream, or even build her own snowman family!\n\nBenny is one of the most eligible bachelors in Big Farm — you can see why with that pearly white smile — but he doesn’t seem to know it. When one of the ladies asks him to a Sadie Hawkins dance, he simply smiles shyly and claims that he’s already married to his work. Young fool, if you ask me!\n\nOf course, now that Tessa Townsend is back in town, rumor has it that his days as a bachelor are numbered...",

Tessa grew into a successful business woman, enjoyed a great career, and achieved everything she set out to get. Nonetheless, she always felt incomplete, like something — or someone — was missing.\n\nTessa dropped everything and moved back to her childhood home in Big Farm. She used her savvy business skills to enter into an up-and-coming niche market: raising home-grown, organic beef.\n\nTessa is committed to her work, but her passion is improving the wellbeing of her community. Tessa cares deeply about the happiness of her neighbors and serves as chairwoman of the local decoration committee.

Back in the day, the horse ranch had just one stable and riding arena and was maintained entirely by its patrons, like my daughter Eva. Not too long ago, however, a young firecracker by the name of Rose McLundy rode into town with big winnings and even bigger plans: to take over the property and make it into a proper horse ranch for training and competitions!\n\nYou wouldn’t believe how many locals have already participated in the tournaments! If you need a good laugh, just watch George on the show jumping track: it’s a miracle that he and his horse, Minnie, could ever win with all that horsing around they do! Even cranky old Lester saddles up Dusty for a quick test of her dressage skills — much to the chagrin of his cat, Bessie, who prefers to have his attention all to herself. When she’s feeling particularly neglected, she jumps straight into the middle of the riding circle to give the horses a proper fright!\n\nAnyone can participate in the horse competitions and tournaments! Just use your hard-earned horseshoes to train your horse and then put him to the test. And if, like me, one horse isn’t enough, you can buy more from the horse market or breed the ones you already have.\n\nWhat’s that you say? You haven’t visited the horse ranch yet?

Rose needed more help to get started, though. That’s why all of us townsfolk have chipped in to help her build and upgrade the necessary facilities. Not only do we want to see her succeed, but the financial investment also pays off when you see how many competitors the tournaments bring in! \n\nEven though Rose is a diligent and dedicated worker, she loves to have some fun as well.

Now that is one crazy — and profitable — storm!\n\nJohnny is also skilled at forecasting when the next monsoon will hit. According to him, it appears like clockwork every 30 days. He even claims to have developed his own countdown. Now if only love could be this predictable...\n\nAll of this is important to know if you ever feel yourself craving some hot beaches and cool drinks at Johnny’s island farm.

Not afraid of a little rain, he saw this as an incredible opportunity to finally make his dream a reality: by building his very own beach bar with original, homemade cocktails and live guitar music.\n\nSo Johnny got to work cultivating the fields and sowing his favorite crops: oranges, peanuts, and grapes. Not long after, he planted orchards for coconuts, bananas, and even mangoes! It’s amazing he was even able to harvest a thing with all the snacking he did, but soon he had collected enough fresh fruit to start making his own delicious cocktails. With names like Tropic Star, Fruity Flip, and Summer Slush, you’d think he had just as much fun coming up with the names of the drinks as he did their recipes!\n\nIn the evenings, Johnny would sit in his comfy hammock and strum some relaxing tunes on his guitar. His favorite themes were the sea, the sand, and the mosquitoes. The melodic music caught the attention of the local lemur population, and it wasn’t long until the bar was overrun by an entire conspiracy of lemurs! Johnny knew he had to get these leaping lemurs under control before the tourists arrived, so he called the only veterinarian he knew: Vicky Ventura.",

Perhaps you’re acquainted with one of her favorites, a teacup pig by the name of Piggles. He’s been under the weather quite frequently as of late, but Vicky always nurtures him back to health — with a little help from her friends like you, of course!\n\nI have to admit, I was a bit surprised when I first heard that Johnny and Vicky were in love. A very unlikely couple, if you ask me. He’s so laid-back, carefree, and — let’s be honest — not the most motivated of workers. Vicky, on the other hand, is a spirited, talented, and diligent worker who always puts the needs of her animals before her own. \n\nAs soon as Vicky heard Johnny’s plea for help, she packed up her things (including Piggles, of course) and traveled to his tropical island to help him find a solution to his pesky lemur problem. It didn’t take her long to discover that the best way to distract lemurs was by giving them tasty fruit to eat. She just wishes they had more!\n\nEven after peace and quiet was restored to the island, at least temporarily, Vicky wasn’t ready to return home just yet. At first, she told herself that it was only the crystal clear waters and hot temperatures that kept her there, but soon she noticed a warm and fuzzy feeling in her heart as well — especially when Johnny was around.",

Each section is divided into 4 cells. The more cells that are active (per section), the more your horse and its breeding partner resemble each other, and the better the result will be. For each matching clock hand, you will get up to 50 genes, depending on the similarity of the attributes or breeding effects.

The more horses on the meadow, the easier it is to find a suitable partner.\nAlternatively, you can do more activities with your horse instead of breeding immediately. In this case, you will have to charge the love meter again to be able to breed, however you get the chance to have a better clock hand selection. You can charge the love meter up to 27 times. Each time, one cell of the wheel will be activated, independent of the horse attributes. This way you can improve your results. Additionally, you will get genes for each section selected by the clock hands during a breeding opportunity. This way it becomes easier to get a high number of genes after each round, whereby the total number of genes per section is 100. The third option for finding a suitable partner is to ask Rose McLundy to catch a suitable wild horse form the prairie behind the horse ranch.",

  "QuestRewardDialog_BennyP_ProjectSquidgoals_2_copy": "Gosh, what an unbearably grizzly smell! Here, take some of my old tools as a thank you. Not all of it, though! Some of my equipment would be too dangerous in your hands, only a real panda knows how to exercise the right to bear arms!",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Benny_ProjectSquidgoals_3_copy": "Haha, April Fools'! It was me all along! Watching you fetch me all those things was so beary funny! Now use these to trick your friends like I tricked you!",

  "QuestRewardDialog_Daniel_Millstack_1_1_copy": "Production is running smoother already! Upgrading the mill to higher levels is even more efficient since then you can produce even more batches of feed at once.",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Daniel_Story1_4_copy": "Hey, it looks like our first investment has paid off! Peter managed to make the chicken farm a success. He's promised to do the same for us if we ever need any help.",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Daniel_Story3_5_copy": "Terrific.\nI'll commission market research to find out what the effects of our investment were.",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Daniel_Story4_2_copy": "Our Smiley Meals are selling like hot cakes and must have been quite the treat for your taste buds - the plates are all empty! Now who's doing the dishes?",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Daniel_Story6_1_copy": "The cook is thrilled! With ingredients as fresh as these, he can whip up a delicious main course. Preparations are already underway.",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Daniel_Story7_3_copy": "That was definitely worth it. I'll quit my job if you don't get anything out of this in the long run.",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Daniel_Story8_5_copy": "That looks good! I took the liberty of including business cards with the packages, so the parents know who to contact for orders.",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Daniel_copy": "My dad will be proud of us!",
  "QuestRewardDialog_George_GeorgeDonateCatfish_copy": "Well, it turns out that catfish don't scare the mice away after all. But cats do! The fish attracted all the neighborhood cats. I've never seen anything like it!",
  "QuestRewardDialog_George_GeorgeDonateFish1_copy": "Farming was and always will be my first and last love! Fishing is fun, but I'm not made for the water. I'm a typical landlubber!",
  "QuestRewardDialog_George_GeorgeFish1_copy": "I can't believe it! It looks like some kind of alien! But what is the big head for? Maybe it stores water in there like a camel.",

  "QuestRewardDialog_George_Mine1_2_copy": "Well done! I almost feel like I did during the Klondike gold rush!",
  "QuestRewardDialog_George_Mine1_3_copy": "Great! You're getting out more gold than you put in. That was the most important lesson I learned back in the Klondike.",
  "QuestRewardDialog_George_Story1_1_copy": "Well, I hope that helped him. He said it did, anyway. But let's see when he'll ask for help again.",
  "QuestRewardDialog_George_Story2_2_copy": "Why all the celebrations? \nBack in the day we only had Christmas! I always got a new shovel under the tree.\nBy the look of things, you've got lots more than that these days.",
  "QuestRewardDialog_George_Story3_3_copy": "Phew! That was a close call. The pigs are gone. But for how long, I wonder...?",
  "QuestRewardDialog_George_Story5_4_copy": "An apple a day keeps the doctor away. \nOr so the saying goes. I prefer to say that a slice of bacon a day keeps the pigs away!",
  "QuestRewardDialog_George_Story6_5_copy": "The auction raised quite a lot of money, and the banquet was a complete success as well. It's smiles all round in the pictures in the Racing Farmer. A complete success!",
  "QuestRewardDialog_George_Story8_3_copy": "Well, we did it better, but parents don't teach kids anything useful these days. Just math and all that theoretical stuff. Who needs that kind of thing anyway?",
  "QuestRewardDialog_George_Story8_4_copy": "Now they know how much better off they are without the taste of chemicals. That was hard work ... I'll just rest my eyes for a minute... zzzz.",
  "QuestRewardDialog_George_copy": "Oh, how nice. Let's drink a fine glass of beetroot juice to that.",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Lester_LesterDonateCarp_copy": "Well, well. That was faster than expected! Maybe you should spend more time fishing and less time farming ... I could always take over the farm so you have more time for your new hobby. What do you think?",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Lester_Story1_3_copy": "Pfft, no matter how much you help, it isn't going to get any better. You're just delaying the inevitable. But go ahead and ruin yourself, it's all the same to me.",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Lester_Story3_1_copy": "Bob won't stop pestering you any time soon. \nOnce you start helping, it's not easy to stop. That's why I ignore things like that.",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Lester_Story4_3_copy": "I really don't get why everyone's making such a fuss about those splotches they call art. Plants belong on the fields or in the barn, not on paper...",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Lester_Story5_3_copy": "Indeed, your apples do not appear to be poisoned like Snow White's. \nBut never say never.\nHowever, a good deed will not go unrewarded.",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Lester_Story7_2_copy": "Lucky. Looks like my ... er ... YOUR farm's soil is pretty resilient.",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Lester_copy": "That worked better than I thought it would...",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Lilly_copy": "You're a natural. The spirits feel it too...",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Matilda_copy": "Very nice. I couldn't have done it better myself. One just has to have a little bit of confidence in young people nowadays!",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Monica_MonicaFishBass_copy": "Look at you! You're already as good as all these pro athletes, except you're a pro fisher!",
  "QuestRewardDialog_OlegBuyBoat__copy": "Now, that's a fine vessel if I ever did see one! Any deckhand worth his salt would be proud to sail on a ship like that.",

  "QuestRewardDialog_OlegFishSalmon_title": "Catch of the day",
  "QuestRewardDialog_OlegFishSwordfish_copy": "Not only have you mastered deep sea fishing, but you have also helped me prepare a banquet that will be talked about for years to come! Thank you so much for your help. As I've said before: Fishermen always pay their debts, so here's a reward for your efforts.",
  "QuestRewardDialog_OlegFishSwordfish_title": "Master of the seas!",
  "QuestRewardDialog_OlegHireDesckHands_copy": "Even the most experienced fishermen need a helping hand when out at sea. A good set of deckhands can keep your boat running ship-shape!",
  "QuestRewardDialog_OlegHireDesckHands_title": "Hire deck hands",
  "QuestRewardDialog_OlegMakeChowder_copy": "Want to know how you tell if your bait is good? Give it a sniff; if it makes you feel like passing out, you know it's good to go!",
  "QuestRewardDialog_OlegMakeChowder_title": "That's the stuff",
  "QuestRewardDialog_OlegNameBoat_copy": "I remember the name of my first boat. It was Janice, she was beautiful... until she sank, of course. But that's another story!",
  "QuestRewardDialog_OlegNameBoat_title": "Great name!",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Oleg_OlegBuyFishingGear1_copy": "Good to see you're following my tips! You'll see how easy fishing can be with the right equipment!",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Oleg_OlegBuyItem_copy": "Good gear gives you a sense confidence, don't you think? Good fishing!",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Oleg_OlegBuyUseItem2_copy": "It's like breadcrumbs for ducks, right? Haha!",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Oleg_OlegBuyUseItem3_copy": "See? It always takes the right resources to succeed! Always a pleasure to help!",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Oleg_OlegBuyUseItem_copy": "So, what do you think? If you're ever feeling lazy, just use these baits. It makes everything much easier!",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Oleg_OlegDonate_copy": "Hooray! I can't believe you managed to rebuild my pole! My father would be proud of you. It's almost as good as my old one. Thank you very much! Now I can finally go fish again!",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Oleg_OlegFish_produce_bass_copy": "I may be old, but I've still got it! I can still remember my first big catch when I was a little boy. I always practiced in the bathtub with Silvy and my toy pole.",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Oleg_OlegGame_copy": "Wow! That was a great first try. Practice a little bit more, and soon you can catch the fish with your eyes closed!",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Oleg_OlegIntro1_copy": "Hooray! I'm glad you've offered to help me out. It's good that I landed near your farm - that Lester guy next door seems like a real sour pickerel!",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Oleg_OlegTrain_copy": "I knew you would be a quick learner! Memorizing all of this stuff can be tough, but once you get the knack, fishing will be easier than breathing!",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Rita_RitaDonateFish1_copy": "Great! There's nothing else standing in the way of the grand opening. Good job!",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Rita_RitaDonateFish2_copy": "Fantastic! Now I have to figure out how I get the fish into that rectangular shape...",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Rita_Story2_1_copy": "Oh, how beautiful. The girls will love all those colorful flowers. \nThe celebration will be sensational, I can feel it.",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Rita_Story2_3_copy": "Marvelous. \nThe celebration will be wonderful. Here's to my organizational skills and your help, of course.",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Rita_Story2_4_copy": "Chocolate, vanilla, strawberry... I can never decide which one is my favorite.\nThanks to your generosity, all scoops are on the house.",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Rita_Story3_4_copy": "Wow, generosity like that calls for a reward. I'll put you on the cover of the Racing Farmer.",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Rita_Story4_1_copy": "What a success! Isn't watching happy children reward enough? I'll take a picture right away and write an article about your help. Readers love these kind of stories!",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Rita_Story5_2_copy": "Oh, how wonderful. \nI'll feature you on the front page as the top benefactor! You'll have new customers beating down your door in no time.",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Rita_Story6_3_copy": "My readers always like charity! Mmm, that apple pie smells so delicious and goes perfectly with a nice cup of coffee.",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Rita_Story8_1_copy": "What beautiful photos! That's all I need for my article. I'll head to the editorial office right away and prepare everything for tomorrow's issue of the Racing Farmer.",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Rita_copy": "Would you mind if I wrote a teensy-weensy article about it?",
  "QuestRewardDialog_TessaFish_copy": "Wow, preparations for the banquet are off to a great start! We'll make a sea captain out of you yet!",
  "QuestRewardDialog_TessaFish_title": "What a catch!",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Tessa_DecoTower1_1_copy": "Isn't it great to walk around the decoration collection looking at everything? I can't wait for you to complete your collection!",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Tessa_IntroTheater1_copy": "Act one: The farmer's daughter and the broker's son meet for the first time. She doesn't like him very much because he seems very snobby. However, the boy starts liking the girl since she's not like all the other spoiled girls he knows.",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Tessa_OlegFish_copy": "I may be old, but I've still got it! I can still remember my first big catch when I was a little boy. I always practiced in the bathtub with Silvy and my toy pole.",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Tessa_Story1_2_copy": "Say, is Peter afraid of chickens? I suppose there's still time. At least he's gotten better with them - thanks to you.",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Tessa_Story2_5_copy": "Pigs, ice cream, and flowers. Sounds like a great party. \nI'll tell Rita we're all set. Here's to you and your help!",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Tessa_Story3_2_copy": "We have the feed. Now all we need are little piglets to feed. It's all a bit like having kids, don't you think?",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Tessa_Story4_4_copy": "Perfect timing! Mmm, can you smell the fresh bread? Just like at my grandparents' place. The cook said she would make some extra for us, too!",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Tessa_Story5_1_copy": "Hooray, the fertilizer has been produced and is ready for use. Let's see what's next.",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Tessa_Story6_2_copy": "Delicious! Wait and see if the side dishes don't steal the show from the main dish. Either way, the vegetarians definitely won't go hungry.",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Tessa_Story6_4_copy": "Good work! The room looks much nicer now. Dinner is ready and the guests should be arriving soon - let's get started!",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Tessa_Story7_1_copy": "Mmm, delicious. There's nothing like fresh milk straight from a cow. \nWhat? What are you looking at?",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Tessa_Story7_4_copy": "What did I tell you? Delicious, fruity, and not too sweet - exactly how a cherry cake should taste!",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Tessa_Story8_2_copy": "Everyone enjoyed that! The children were a little hesitant at first, but once a couple had plucked up the courage, you couldn't tear them away from the animals.",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Tessa_TessaDonateFish1_copy": "I hope I do everything right! It's not that easy to roll the rice into the nori without losing half of it!",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Tessa_TessaDonatePickerel_copy": "Great! I hope I can convince her to buy her fish from the organic market the next time. It's worth it, even though she has to come all the way from the city.",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Tessa_TessaFish1_copy": "Working hard feels good, right? I can sleep better at night knowing that I achieved something during the day!",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Tessa_Theater2_copy": "Act two: The girl and the boy get to know each other and the farmer's daughter realizes that the boy isn't as bad as she thought. They become friends and she shows him her world, but then her father recognizes the boy as the broker's son and tells him to leave.",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Tessa_Theater3_copy": "Act three: Even though her father forbade her from seeing the boy ever again, the farmer's daughter visited him in the big city. However, she slowly realized that she didn't fit into his world. Besides, his father didn't like her very much either and sadly, she decided to return home.",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Tessa_Theater4_copy": "Act four: The broker's son goes to see the farmer's daughter but she doesn't want to listen to him - until her father shows up and tries to banish the boy. However, when the broker's son declares his love to the farmer's daughter, the farmer realizes that the pair belong together.",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Tessa_VickyDonateCarpBass_copy": "Oh, how wonderful! You really saved the day! I'll make sure that the truck reaches the foster kittens this time!",

  "QuestRewardDialog_Vicky_Pet1_1_copy": "Looking good! Your new friend will feel right at home in this doghouse.",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Vicky_Pet1_2_copy": "Sounds good! The more often you call your dog by name, the faster your bond will grow.",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Vicky_Pet1_3_copy": "Check out that shiny coat! This is certainly the result of great dog food!",
  "QuestRewardDialog_Vicky_Pet1_4_copy": "Just look how happy your dog is! The little guy learned a new trick right away. You'd better keep practicing!",

  "Quest_ThemeFairytale_9_reward": "Well, it's not quite the diamond encrusted crown every little girl dreams of, but it will certainly do the trick for our play's wicked queen! Now I just hope Greta won't be offended when I ask her to play the part!",

  "Quest_candyFarmQue5_title": "A good plan",
  "Quest_candyFarmQue6_copy": "Imagine if we had to grind the sweet almonds we harvest by hand - what a job! Just thinking about it makes my arms feel sore. I'm glad we have such a nice crushing mill now.",

  "Quest_candyFarmQue8_title": "Worth a try",

  "Quest_tropicalFarmCha1Que3Add2_copy": "These mango leaves remind me of tree leaves back home. And you can use them to make humus for fields. Should we give it a go with the mango leaves?",
  "Quest_tropicalFarmCha1Que3Add2_reward": "The color is definitely a bit different, but the humus has the same sweet and ripe smell. It worked out great!",
  "Quest_tropicalFarmCha1Que3Add2_title": "Different and yet the same?",
  "Quest_tropicalFarmCha1Que3Add3_copy": "The soil in the tropics is generally very low in nutrients. But if we take good care of our cultivation areas, they'll produce large yields. The yield also depends on using the right fertilizer, of course.",

  "Quest_tropicalFarmCha1Que4Add1_copy": "A mango pip takes between a week and three months to germinate. The actual pip is under the hard case of the stone in the flesh of the fruit. It looks like a peanut and is around the same size. At least that's what I read during my siesta in the hammock.",

  "Quest_tropicalFarmCha1Que4_copy": "I think we need a few more oranges – we've got enough mangos in stock now. Let's get some from the field and then we can try out the new cocktail recipe. Hopefully the lemurs haven't stolen half of the harvest again.",

  "Quest_tropicalFarmCha2Que1_title": "Watch out, ringtails!",
  "Quest_tropicalFarmCha2Que2Add1_copy": "Unfortunately, the rise of agriculture in the tropics has also meant that lots of forests have been cleared. The ash adds nutrients to the fields, but the cultivation areas can only be used for one year. We can do better, don't you think?",

  "Quest_tropicalFarmCha2Que5Add2_title": "Skilled handiwork",
  "Quest_tropicalFarmCha2Que5_copy": "Have you noticed that it's looking a bit empty in our barn? I don't think it's just the lemurs. Maybe we should get some fertilizer to improve our harvests.",

  "Quest_tropicalFarmCha3Que1Add3_copy": "With a height of up to 45 meters, a mango tree like this one is almost twice as big as trees in temperate climates. Can you imagine how many lemurs could live on a tree like that?",

The beach bar was pretty small and a bit rundown, but now it's really comfortable and has space for lots of guests. And I've already given some thought to how we can fit even more guests in...",

  "Quest_tropicalFarmCha3Que1_title": "Trading frenzy",
  "Quest_tropicalFarmCha3Que2Add1_copy": "A peacock must have escaped from the coop last night. First he sat on the roof of the beach bar making a racket, then he hopped onto the bar and swallowed all the corks. Then he wandered off back to his coop by himself.",
  "Quest_tropicalFarmCha3Que2Add1_reward": "Our peacocks seem much happier since the coop was upgraded. They're still very loud, but they've stopped breaking out.",
  "Quest_tropicalFarmCha3Que2Add1_title": "A wayward bird",
  "Quest_tropicalFarmCha3Que2Add2_copy": "Some things are never finished! Our beach bar is definitely one of them - there are always repairs or improvements to be made. For instance, we could reinforce the roof. The storms here don't last long, but they can be severe.",
  "Quest_tropicalFarmCha3Que2Add2_reward": "Now we have more space for guests, a bigger bar, and more glasses – maybe we should expand our range of cocktails?",
  "Quest_tropicalFarmCha3Que2Add2_title": "Well equipped?",
  "Quest_tropicalFarmCha3Que2_copy": "I think we need a few more coconuts! Last time, the guests were drinking the cocktails faster than we could make them. Or was that because of the little umbrellas?",
  "Quest_tropicalFarmCha3Que2_reward": "Wow, so many coconuts! Do you have any ideas as to what we could do with the coconut shells?",
  "Quest_tropicalFarmCha3Que2_title": "Coconut creation",
  "Quest_tropicalFarmCha3Que3Add1_copy": "The banana trees here aren't that big, but they're more robust than the grape vines. We just have to make sure that all the trees have enough space, otherwise our harvest will suffer.",
  "Quest_tropicalFarmCha3Que3Add1_reward": "Now we've got so many bananas that it doesn't matter if the lemurs steal a few here or there.",
  "Quest_tropicalFarmCha3Que3Add1_title": "Pretty bushes",
  "Quest_tropicalFarmCha3Que3Add2_copy": "Benny was the first to try my home-mixed cocktails. We made a real mess in my mom's kitchen. Luckily he gave me the confidence to make my beach bar idea into a reality.",
  "Quest_tropicalFarmCha3Que3Add2_reward": "This coconut milk is so tasty! Thanks to the big palm trees, we can now harvest much more of it.",
  "Quest_tropicalFarmCha3Que3Add2_title": "A true friend",
  "Quest_tropicalFarmCha3Que3_copy": "Four different types of fruit juice from ripe, juicy fruits, crushed ice, a bit of soda, and a little squeeze of lemon, topped with a few sprigs of mint – my latest creation is finished. I could do this all day!",
  "Quest_tropicalFarmCha3Que3_reward": "Wonderful! It's always best to use the ingredients when they're still fresh. Quickly, before the lemurs get wind of it!",
  "Quest_tropicalFarmCha3Que3_title": "Just my kind of thing",
  "Quest_tropicalFarmCha3Que4Add1_copy": "If we could train the lemurs to help us with peeling the bananas, I'm sure we would be three times as fast. Then we could also take better care of the banana trees.",
  "Quest_tropicalFarmCha3Que4Add1_reward": "We've done quite a lot today. I'm going to relax for a bit before the first guests arrive.",
  "Quest_tropicalFarmCha3Que4Add1_title": "Ringed tails everywhere!",

  "Quest_tropicalFarmCha3Que4_title": "The big rush",
  "Quest_tropicalFarmCha3Que5Add1_copy": "Animals like to be comfortable as well. Peacocks are magnificent animals - they'll appreciate it. I think what we need most if we want to expand their coop is wood and more banana leaves.",
  "Quest_tropicalFarmCha3Que5Add1_reward": "I wonder if peacocks can swim ... If we get any more of them, they'd better learn – we're running out of space!",
  "Quest_tropicalFarmCha3Que5Add1_title": "Even more room",
  "Quest_tropicalFarmCha3Que5_copy": "With the bananas that you collected and the other fruits in the barn, we should be able to make a true cocktail masterpiece. A fruity fireworks display! An explosion of flavor!",

  "Quest_tropicalFarmTutorial4_title": "More space for creativity",
  "Quest_tropicalFarmTutorial5_copy": "When I arrived two years ago, I couldn't believe all the exotic flora and fauna around here! Have you spotted any wild animals yet? A bit of feed is always a good way to tempt them out into the open. We'll have to produce it first though.",

  "Quest_tropicalFarmTutorial5_title": "A big project",
  "Quest_tropicalFarmTutorial6_copy": "Lots of the locals use seashells as a kind of currency. I'm not sure what you can buy with them, but it definitely can't hurt to have a lot of seashells.",

Odd... but that made me think of something: I'd like to breed penguins here and then release them into the wild to help preserve their species. Of course we need to get some things ready first!",

  "Quest_winNightFarmCha1Que3Add1_title": "You've got a good nose for it!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha1Que3Add2_copy": "It's good that we don't throw anything away here. Everything can be used again in some way. Even the plant debris can be put to good use!",

  "Quest_winNightFarmCha1Que5Add1_title": "Plow on through",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha1Que5Add2_copy": "Can you hear that too? Our penguins always start chattering at the same time. You can almost set your watch to them. I think they're just trying to tell us that they could use a little snack!",

  "Quest_winNightFarmCha1Que5Add2_title": "Feeding time!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha1Que5_copy": "It seems like it's time to release some of our penguins into the wild! A team of biologists will take care of that for us. Since we handled the work of raising the penguins for them, they're thanking us with a gift of a few runestones which they found here during their research.",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha1Que5_reward": "Excellent! I'm so proud that we've already achieved some of our ambitious goals. We make such a great team!",

  "Quest_winNightFarmCha2Que1Add2_copy": "I think it'd be a good idea to upgrade our silo again. Otherwise soon we won't know where to put all our dung! And we also don't want our old one to burst its seams. Just imagine cleaning up that mess...",

  "Quest_winNightFarmCha2Que1_intro2": "Now that I think about it, we could really take care of our fish breeding a bit more. That would be an important next step for us.",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha2Que1_reward": "Our idea is paying off! But given that we're such successful farmers, it's surprising how much we've had to do with fish lately! Hmm...",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha2Que1_title": "Give the fish some chips",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha2Que2Add1_copy": "Here, take a handful of dirt and rub it between your hands. Take a sniff! Doing this always tells a good farmer what his soil needs.",

  "Quest_winNightFarmCha2Que2Add2_title": "Berry good prospects...",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha2Que2_copy": "For each tree we chop down, we immediately plant a new one. That ensures our work remains sustainable and we'll never leave the island completely barren.",

  "Quest_winNightFarmCha2Que2_title": "Knock on wood!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha2Que3Add1_copy": "Every now and then I take a hike through our tree orchards and enjoy the stillness and solitude. It's almost like meditation, and the fresh air helps you clear your head.",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha2Que3Add1_reward": "Trees grow a bit slower in this cold climate. But this makes their wood harder and more durable.",

  "Quest_winNightFarmCha2Que3Add2_title": "More space for breeding!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha2Que3Add3_copy": "Our mill works around the clock to produce enough feed. We really need to upgrade it, otherwise we won't be able to properly feed our animals anymore!",

  "Quest_winNightFarmCha2Que3Add3_title": "We're coming around!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha2Que3_copy": "I've really enjoyed working with you! I get the feeling that we're on the same wavelength when it comes to this farm.",

  "Quest_winNightFarmCha2Que3_title": "Team spirit",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha2Que4Add1_copy": "Have you also noticed how our seals can bark? It's a shame that we're going to release them into the wild. Otherwise we could train them to be our guard dogs!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha2Que4Add1_reward": "Great! The new ponds are done. And our seals are barking for joy because now they have more room for swimming!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha2Que4Add1_title": "What is that I hear?",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha2Que4Add2_copy": "Luckily we don't have any neighbors near here. Then we would definitely get some complaints about our silo. At times it can smell a bit... aromatic.",

  "Quest_winNightFarmCha2Que4Add2_title": "Nose job!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha2Que4_copy": "As a kid, I always dreamed of having my own real viking helmet and sailing the world with a longship. I'm sure other people have had the same dream. Let's try to sell some viking helmets!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha2Que4_reward": "I love this helmet! But don't wear it into the penguin pool. The horns always scare them away!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha2Que4_title": "Hang onto your hat!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha2Que5Add1_copy": "I'm not sure if the old vikings also processed their animal dung into fertilizer. Maybe they dried it and then burned it for heat. Wood is simply too valuable to burn here.",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha2Que5Add1_reward": "Very good! We've already mucked out the penguin pool. Can we move onto the seals next?",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha2Que5Add1_title": "Purely natural!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha2Que5Add2_copy": "I've believed in this project from the start! And as you can see, it has turned into a great success. Sales of our viking products are soaring! We'll have to start producing them even faster now...",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha2Que5Add2_reward": "The best thing about the viking workshop is that everything we produce is absolutely top quality!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha2Que5Add2_title": "Top quality work",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha2Que5_copy": "You always have to keep an eye on fertilizer and algae production for a farm to run smoothly. Otherwise we'll exhaust our fields and eventually we won't have any more good harvests!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha2Que5_reward": "It does a body good to break a sweat every now and then. Every farmer should be able to get his hands dirty!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha2Que5_title": "The soil will thank us!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que1Add1_copy": "I have an idea on how we could expand our range even more! Let's bring a few sheep onto the farm and give it a go.",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que1Add1_reward": "This pasture is a good addition to our fields, orchards, and groves. And the white sheep go great with the white snow here!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que1Add1_title": "His fleece was white as snow...",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que1Add2_copy": "How did the old vikings manage it? They must have actually dug out every inch of earth by hand. And their tools certainly weren't as good as ours!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que1Add2_reward": "The soil feels much better now. It's loose and can hold its moisture for longer.",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que1Add2_title": "This is getting tough!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que1Add3_copy": "Our tree groves aren't just good for producing wood – they also offer an attractive habitat for birds and rodents.",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que1Add3_reward": "Our trees are growing wonderfully! Nice, straight trunks... They will make excellent timber for us.",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que1Add3_title": "Let's reforest!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que1_copy": "Maybe we should start offering tours of the farm. There would definitely be lots of people who would be interested in that. And if everyone bought a rustic viking tankard as a souvenir... Where is my calculator?",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que1_intro1": "What we've built here is completely one-of-a-kind! We're running a sustainable and environmentally friendly business, we're actively involved in protecting endangered species, and we're even teaching people a little something about viking culture at the same time.",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que1_reward": "I'm happy that we've had so much success with our farm. You've really helped me to try my hand at living out the life of my ancestors.",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que1_title": "An eye-opening example!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que2Add1_copy": "Take a look at our penguins! Some of them are true comedians. Someday, someone's bound to think of making a funny film with a few penguins in it.",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que2Add1_reward": "Good that our penguins finally have more space to run about. The pools were long overdue for an upgrade!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que2Add1_title": "Comedy in black and white",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que2Add2_copy": "Our viking workshop only makes products of the highest quality. But everything also takes a bit longer than in a factory. We should definitely invest in an upgrade again.",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que2Add2_reward": "Great! Now we have a workshop to be proud of. We're truly setting new standards.",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que2Add2_title": "Everything made by hand!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que2_copy": "I prefer to leave the berry picking to others. My back just can't handle it after a while. The vikings were probably a lot shorter than us, so they didn't need to bend over as far.",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que2_reward": "Haha, I think more berries landed in your mouth than in the bucket! Your red mouth gives it away.",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que2_title": "Berries or back pain?",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que3Add1_copy": "Every time I try to count the exact number of sheep in our herd, I start to yawn. Do you think it's true that counting sheep helps you fall asleep?",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que3Add1_reward": "Wow, you're already done with the pasture? Great! I think I nodded off there for a second. But now I feel really refreshed!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que3Add1_title": "Counting sheep...",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que3Add2_copy": "The berries seem to take well to the climate here. We should use that to our advantage and grow even more of them!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que3Add2_reward": "Great! I bet we'll soon be harvesting more berries than we can carry!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que3Add2_title": "Fruit of the north",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que3_copy": "If we continue on like this, we'll become famous soon. Yesterday we were even mentioned in the Northern Gazette: they described us as &quot;an up-and-coming company with a strong focus on protecting animals&quot;. Great!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que3_reward": "You can tell that we're into the groove now. Everything seems to be going faster than it did at the start.",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que3_title": "Name and rank",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que4Add1_copy": "Did you know that sheep are one of the oldest pets? It's thought that they were first domesticated over 11,000 years ago!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que4Add1_reward": "You made a smart decision by expanding the sheep pastures. The animals now have enough room to graze and get some exercise too!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que4Add1_title": "Pets with a long history",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que4_copy": "Every time I see our wool, I remember how back in my college days I used to pass the time in long and boring lectures by knitting warm socks under my desk. Then I gave them to the professors as gifts!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que4_reward": "You're a true and dependable friend! Here I am taking a trip down memory lane while you take care of the farm. Thank you!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que4_title": "Knitting circle",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que5Add1_copy": "Our penguin breeding has been extremely successful. Almost all of the pairs have already laid an egg. This means that soon we'll have lots of baby penguins to take care of! We're probably going to need more space. How about expanding the pools?",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que5Add1_reward": "That must be big enough now. Now we just have to wait until those youngsters come out. Are you as excited as I am to meet our new friends?",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que5Add1_title": "Hatching time",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que5_copy": "All of my dreams are starting to become reality! I'd like to thank you once again for helping me with so much energy through all of this. You're the best!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que5_reward": "Everything is running like clockwork! Old Barnacle was right. You really know your stuff and don't mind getting your hands dirty!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmCha3Que5_title": "The farm is running better and better...",
  "Quest_winNightFarmMoneyExchange_copy": "Nordic countries have different currencies than we do, of course. Why don't you try exchanging some money? That will be good preparation for your stay here on the island.",
  "Quest_winNightFarmMoneyExchange_intro1": "Good night! Er, ... welcome, I mean! You must be the helper I so desperately need. Barnacle has already told me lots about you. He has a very high opinion of you. Come on, first I'll show you what our nightlife is like on this farm!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmMoneyExchange_intro2": "Don't let the darkness fool you! We're literally turning night into day here, because on this farm we like to keep our fields and stables going 24/7. So let's roll up our sleeves and get started!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmMoneyExchange_reward": "Blimey! Do you get that feeling, too? As soon as you get the foreign money in your hands, you're even more excited about the trip.",
  "Quest_winNightFarmMoneyExchange_title": "Let's get started, night owl!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmStart_copy": "Aye. An old matey of mine, Nils Nordson, could really do with your help on his farm up north. He has always been a go-getter, but he also appreciates help from others. I think that you two would be a great team!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmStart_reward": "Arrr! As a reward for your commitment I'll give you this bonus for your travel funds!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmStart_title": "After dark ...",
  "Quest_winNightFarmTutorial1_copy": "Flax is one of our most important resources. We grow it here and use it to make all kinds of things - just like the vikings did. We need so much of it! But I'm sure a successful farmer like you can manage that with no trouble.",
  "Quest_winNightFarmTutorial1_intro1": "Don't let the darkness fool you! We're literally turning night into day here, because on this farm we like to keep our fields and stables going 24/7. So let's roll up our sleeves and get started!",

  "Quest_winNightFarmTutorial1_title": "Night owl",
  "Quest_winNightFarmTutorial2_copy": "My forefathers used to make warm and very durable clothing out of flax. It's still made the same way, but I've updated the design to keep with the times. It will really make heads turn!",

  "Quest_winNightFarmTutorial2_title": "Stylish and natural",
  "Quest_winNightFarmTutorial3_copy": "The two of us definitely can't manage all this on our own. And if we hire new workers, we'll have to give them a warm bed to sleep in too! You can take care of that, right?",
  "Quest_winNightFarmTutorial3_reward": "Good job! That's exactly how I imagined it: functional and sturdy, but still a cozy place to live. The new workers will feel right at home here.",
  "Quest_winNightFarmTutorial3_title": "Blueprints",
  "Quest_winNightFarmTutorial4_copy": "We're going to need a lot of space for producing, processing, and houses in the future. I can already see it! We should definitely be prepared and expand the farm now while we have time to spare. Can you take care of that?",
  "Quest_winNightFarmTutorial4_reward": "Where would I be without your help? We're moving forward!",
  "Quest_winNightFarmTutorial4_title": "Steady growth",
  "Quest_winNightFarmTutorial5_copy": "I think I've already told you about my plans to breed endangered animals and then release them into the wild, right? We're definitely going to need to feed these little ones, and what better way than by making the feed ourselves?",
  "Quest_winNightFarmTutorial5_reward": "Perfect! We've got enough feed now. Soon we can start caring for some little animals.",
  "Quest_winNightFarmTutorial5_title": "Big plans",
  "Quest_winNightFarmTutorial6_copy": "Do you know what runestones are? They were used for rituals back in the old days. Let's try to trade our farm products for runestones. Maybe the stones will even tell us something about the lives of my ancestors.",

  "Quest_winterFarmAirport1_intro1": "Aye, have I told you about my legendary sailing trip around the North Cape yet? While I was there, I met a brave young fellow out on the Arctic sea. Nils Nordson was his name! He was on a polar expedition to research the mating habits of polar bears.",
  "Quest_winterFarmAirport1_intro2": "He now lives on a viking farm where he's learning about the lives of his ancestors. \nHe recently asked me if I happened to know a successful farmer who could help him set up his winter farm.",

  "Quest_winterFarmAirport2_title": "Preparing for the trip",
  "Quest_winterFarmAirport3_copy": "Which is what I would say now, but you're getting on a plane instead! \nSo far you've proven your skills by playing missions, donating certificates, and exchanging money, all to help out my old matey Nils. His mouth will drop when he sees this!",
  "Quest_winterFarmAirport3_reward": "Nils, that lucky duck! With your help, his viking farm will be a hit - I'm sure of it!",
  "Quest_winterFarmAirport3_title": "Cast off!",
  "Quest_winterFarmCha1Que1Add1_copy": "We're on the right track, but our efficiency still leaves something to be desired. Come on, let's grab a couple of spades and roll up our sleeves! We really need a bigger area to cultivate.",
  "Quest_winterFarmCha1Que1Add1_reward": "Done! Now we have two fields and can grow twice as much in the same time. How efficient!",
  "Quest_winterFarmCha1Que1Add1_title": "Time to put your hand to the plow!",
  "Quest_winterFarmCha1Que1Add2_copy": "Have you taken a look at our mill lately? It could really use some modernizing. We can't move forward with such outdated technology. How about investing some snow dollars so we can keep up with the competition?",
  "Quest_winterFarmCha1Que1Add2_reward": "Look at you go! Now we've equipped our traditional stone mill with some state-of-the-art technology. If only my ancestors could see us now!",
  "Quest_winterFarmCha1Que1Add2_title": "Always cutting-edge",
  "Quest_winterFarmCha1Que1Add3_copy": "Even the vikings knew it: the right motivation can work wonders! That's why I'm going to give a drinking horn full of mead to whoever collects the most flax stems today!",

  "Quest_winterFarmCha1Que1Add3_title": "Hard-working helpers",
  "Quest_winterFarmCha1Que1Add4_copy": "It's suddenly dawned on me: my farm still doesn't have a name! Before you arrived, I always had so much to do that I didn't even consider it.

  "Quest_winterFarmCha1Que1Add4_reward": "Wow! You can really tell that this isn't the first farm you've named.",
  "Quest_winterFarmCha1Que1Add4_title": "The name is everything",
  "Quest_winterFarmCha1Que1_copy": "Could you start growing flax so we have enough material? Then we can start production in the viking workshop. You know the drill!",
  "Quest_winterFarmCha1Que1_intro1": "It seems like you've really settled in here! Building, harvesting, producing, and selling should be second nature to you by now! At the end of the day, you're the successful farmer here, and you know how things go!",
  "Quest_winterFarmCha1Que1_intro2": "It's about time we boost production a bit! I really think viking fashion is an emerging market. With your help, I can definitely make the tunic a best seller!",

  "Quest_winterFarmCha1Que1_title": "Success story",

  "Quest_winterFarmCha3Que2Add2_title": "Everything made by hand!",
  "Quest_winterFarmCha3Que2_copy": "I prefer to leave the berry picking to others. My back just can't handle it after a while. The vikings were probably a lot shorter than us, so they didn't need to bend over as far.",

  "Quest_winterFarmCha3Que3Add2_title": "Fruit of the north",
  "Quest_winterFarmCha3Que3_copy": "If we continue on like this, we'll become famous soon. Yesterday we were even mentioned in the Northern Gazette: they described us as &quot;an up-and-coming company with a strong focus on protecting animals&quot;. Great!",

  "Quest_winterFarmTutorial3_copy": "One thing is clear: as much as I'd like it to just be the two of us, we need some help! I'll hire some workers. But wait, they'll need a roof over their heads too. Let's build them some nice accommodations so they aren't left out in the cold.",
  "Quest_winterFarmTutorial3_reward": "Good job! That's exactly how I imagined it: functional and sturdy, but still a cozy place to live. The new workers will feel right at home here.",
  "Quest_winterFarmTutorial3_title": "A cozy little home",
  "Quest_winterFarmTutorial4_copy": "We're going to need a lot of space for producing, processing, and houses in the future. I can already see it! We should definitely be prepared and expand the farm now while we have time to spare. Can you take care of that?",

  "Quest_winterFarmTutorial4_title": "Steady growth",
  "Quest_winterFarmTutorial5_copy": "I think I've already told you about my plans to breed endangered animals and then release them into the wild, right? We're definitely going to need to feed these little ones, and what better way than by making the feed ourselves?",

  "Quest_xmasFarmCha3Que1_copy": "Maybe we should start offering holiday-themed tours of the farm. There are definitely lots of people who would be interested in that. And what if everyone bought a reindeer carving as a souvenir ... Now where is my calculator?",
  "Quest_xmasFarmCha3Que1_intro1": "The farm's extra holiday business is going great!\nWe've set up a sustainable production process with organic farming, and we're helping people get in the holiday spirit. It's a win-win situation for everybody!",

  "Quest_xmasFarmCha3Que2Add2_title": "Everything made by hand!",
  "Quest_xmasFarmCha3Que2_copy": "Berry picking isn't my thing. My back just can't handle it after a while. You look much shorter than me, so you wouldn't need to bend over as far.",

  "Quest_xmasFarmStart_copy": "Aye. An old matey of mine, Nils Nordson, could really do with your help on his farm up north. He has always been a go-getter, but he also appreciates help from others. I think that you two would be a great team!",

  "Quest_xmasFarmStart_title": "Do you want to help?",
  "Quest_xmasFarmTutorial1_copy": "Red flax is one of our most important resources. We grow it here, and thanks to its natural red color, we don't need any dyes later on. Convenient, right? But we need so much of it! I'm sure a successful farmer like you can manage that with no trouble.",

  "Quest_xmasFarmTutorial2_title": "Stylish and natural",
  "Quest_xmasFarmTutorial3_copy": "The two of us definitely can't manage all this on our own. And if we hire new workers, we'll have to give them a warm bed to sleep in too! You can take care of that, right?",

Everyone is pitching in to get it all done in time.\nBut this year was different from the rest. Santa locked himself in his workshop for days and wouldn't stop working. He's never been in there alone for so long before! All of us reindeer felt neglected. Then, when I discovered this ginormous sack of gifts, I knew I didn't want to be Santa's pack horse any longer.

All of us reindeer were always by his side, bringing him tools and wood, and we would carry the heavy paint cans into the workshop to give him everything he needed to make the toys.

And it has a huge feeding trough as well ... I wanted to give this gift to my reindeer to thank them for all their help over the years. It was supposed to be a surprise. I spent days working on it alone in my workshop!\n\nIf you see Rudolph, please tell him that the children won't get their gifts this year without him. I need his help. He's the best lead reindeer in the world, you know! \n\nYou should also get a reward for your help.",

I don't know what all the fuss is about,” said Lester, shivering slightly from the cold.\n “Look more closely,” replied the ghost.\n Lester peered through the window and examined the scene once again, only this time he noticed that the twins, normally so wide-eyed and full of life, were not their usual smiling selves. \n “They were carol singing and spreading joy around the farms,” said the ghost, “but someone slammed the door in their faces and they haven't opened their mouths since.”\n Lester watched as the other members of the farm tried to console the young boys, but their faces showed no signs of festivity. \n“What will become of them?” Lester asked the ghost. “Has their Christmas been ruined by my coldness?”\n “It's never too late to make amends,” replied the ghost. &quot;But I must leave you now, I have big deadline tomorrow...eh, I mean, I have spooky things to attend to!&quot;",

He couldn't be sure, but through the smoke it looked as though the ghost was holding a turtle.\n “Aloha!” said the spirit. \n“Are you the final ghost?&quot;\n “I am here to show you your Christmases yet to come.”\n&quot;Are you holding a turtle?&quot;\n&quot;Yes, her name is Shelly!

This year we could do without you bah-humbugging the joy out of Christmas.”\n Lester opened his eyes with a gasp. He was in his room with the ghost and her turtle once more. \n “I never thought I would see the day when Matilda wouldn't donate some food! She’s one of the most generous people I know. Am I really such an old curmudgeon?”\n “There is still time to…”\n “Make amends, yes I know,” interrupted Lester, suddenly full of enthusiasm. “I will start right away!”",

A chilly breeze tickled his cheeks as the window across the room burst open, but the old man didn’t seem to notice as he continued to snore away. \nHis attention was soon roused, however, when he heard what sounded like the clip clopping of hooves on his wooden floor. He peered up over the back of the armchair and saw… no, it couldn’t be…. a ghost!?\n“Wh-wh--who are you? What are you doing in my house?”\n“I have come to tell you that you'll be visited by three ghosts before Christmas arrives. It's about time you were shown the true meaning of Christmas.”\n“Bah,” said Lester, “Humbug! There's no such thing as ghosts. I'm just seeing things. Yes, I bet it's just that cheese from the farm next door. I knew that stuff was no good.” \n “This is no dream, Lester. Remember, three ghosts before Christmas day arrives...”\nAnd with a puff of smoke, the ghost was gone.",

From the smoke emerged a pale figure.\n “Lester, I am the Ghost of, erm, oh, what was it … ah yes, Christmas Past … I think,” rambled the spirit, coughing and waving his arms to clear the smoke. \n Lester examined the figure that stood before him. “You look oddly familiar, Ghost. Have we met?”\n “What? Oh, no, no. I'm the Ghost of Christmas Past, and I have come to take you on a trip back in time. Now, close your eyes and your journey will begin…”",

He was daydreaming, imagining the money he would make once he finally got his hands on George’s farm. It was a daydream that never failed to bring a smile to his lips. \n His daydreaming was soon interrupted, however, by George himself, who was carrying a basket full of food.\n “Season's greetings, Lester! I have here the makings of a wonderful Christmas meal for us both, will you join me?”\n “I am amazed you've been able to gather enough food for a meal; from where I've been sitting, your fields have looked rather bare of late.”\n “It's been a tough harvest this year for sure, but what I have, I am willing to share with you.”\n“Unless that basket contains the deed to your farm, George, you can be on your merry way. I've got no time for your foolishness today.”\nLester opened his eyes with a gasp and was back in his room with the ghost.\n “I was so rude to him when all he wanted was to share his meager pickings with me.”\n “It's never too late to make amends, Lester...” replied the ghost, and with another puff of smoke, he was gone.",

I wonder if Professor James can help.\n\nI went to visit elves this morning with some music to lift their spirits. We listened to Sled Zeppelin, Bonbon Jovi, Amy Mulled-Winehouse - all their favourites, but they didn’t even raise a smile. Not even Elfis Presley did the trick, and he always gets them dancing.

The atmosphere isn’t exactly jolly at the moment, I can tell you!\n\nThe biggest problem, however, is that we’re a little behind schedule with the toy making. It hasn’t helped that all the elves have fallen ill! At first we thought they were just suffering from low-elf esteem, hehehe, but unfortunately it seems like something more than that. We took them to see a gnome-opath, but he couldn’t find what was wrong. These are worrying times indeed. \n\nIt’s always wonderful catching-up with you, farmer, but I have a lot of people to talk to and very little time. Before I go, I have brought you some gifts for letting me stay on your lovely farm. Here, take this.",
