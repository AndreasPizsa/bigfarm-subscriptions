How should I deliver all the gifts without my most loyal and hard-working lead reindeer by my side?!\n\nDear Rudolph, please come back soon! This year I even made an extra special gift for my reindeers - they're getting a new, bigger stable with its own stove to keep them warm and cozy all year. And it has a huge feeding trough as well ... I wanted to give this gift to my reindeer to thank them for all their help over the years. It was supposed to be a surprise. I spent days working on it alone in my workshop!\n\nIf you see Rudolph, please tell him that the children won't get their gifts this year without him. I need his help.

No, I'm sure he wouldn't do that ... \nThe thing is, I may be free now, but I also have no tasks, no responsibilities, and no family here. \n\nAnd I'm still wondering why Santa wanted to spend so many hours alone in his workshop this year. All of us reindeer were always by his side, bringing him tools and wood, and we would carry the heavy paint cans into the workshop to give him everything he needed to make the toys.

I'm simply not used to sleeping in the woods. The nights are long, dark, and ice cold. And in the morning the grass is so frozen that I can't eat even one strand.

I bet it smells like wood and cookies, and in the afternoon the sweet fragrance of rose hip tea, Santa's favorite, wafts through the air. In the evening, everyone joins together at the fireplace to munch on chocolate cookies and baked apples. Santa loves to eat them with lots of honey, but that's way too sweet if you ask me ...\n\nI wonder if Santa has already chosen another lead reindeer to replace me?",

The people here are also friendly and hard-working. \n\nSanta's workshop is usually really busy this time of year trying to finish all the gifts. Everyone is pitching in to get it all done in time.\nBut this year was different from the rest. Santa locked himself in his workshop for days and wouldn't stop working. He's never been in there alone for so long before! All of us reindeer felt neglected. Then, when I discovered this ginormous sack of gifts, I knew I didn't want to be Santa's pack horse any longer.

  "CoopSmugglerYarn14_copy": "Have you visited our organic market yet? Before Eva made it organic, it was a simple farmer’s market with an incredible array of stands and products! It wasn’t always that way, though. We once had to do all our shopping at the local BigMart! This megastore had everything you could ever want, and although the quality was low, the prices were even lower. But the local mom &amp; pop shops couldn’t compete with this greedy giant, and it wasn’t long until Main Street was only a ghost town littered with For Sale signs.\n\nThe local cultural society knew they had to do something to save the town! They locked themselves in a room with only some milk, apple turnovers, and the promise that they wouldn’t come out until they had come up with a plan to save Big Farm. Half an hour later, they emerged with big smiles and half empty plates of apple turnovers. \n\nMargaret Cooper, Daniel’s grandmother and the town matriarch at the time, proudly stood before the crowd that had gathered and announced: “If we can sell one of these turnovers for 2 dollars, just imagine how much money we could make with 5,000 of them!” Thus, the idea of the market was born. At first, no one believed that one customer would ever need 5,000 apple turnovers, but you’d be surprised how hungry the kids at the local youth hostel can get!",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn12_copy": "It’s said that to plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow. I don’t know if that’s true, but I sure do believe that working with your hands is the best therapy there is. That’s why I’ve built my shack into a corner of our local greenhouse!\n\nEver since I was a kid, the greenhouse has fascinated me. With its gleaming glass walls, it’s hard to miss — especially on a farm that never has a cloudy day! Barnacle and I spent hours running through the rows of fruit trees and bushes, imagining that we were being chased by colossal beasts in some faraway jungle.\n\nNow that we’re old men, Barnacle and I have been to almost every tropical paradise we could find. But our favorite place will always be the rain forest, and that’s why we both love doing business on that far off island. Do you know why the tribe makes silver horseshoes? The island has always been full of silver, but the islanders never knew what to do with this mysterious shiny metal. Then, according to legend, a wooden horseshoe washed up on the beach during the night. The puzzled islanders didn’t know what to make of it. Was it for hunting, cooking, maybe a necklace? Not long after, a whole mess of products washed up at the same spot. The islanders discovered their first flashlight, steel knife, and even a white ball named Wilson! Amazed by their good fortune, the islanders thanked the horseshoe for the gifts and prayed for more. To increase their luck, they made some of their own horseshoes with the only material they could find: precious silver.",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn11_copy": "My twin brother Barnacle and I were quite the rascals back in the day, even worse than those redhead boys, Jim and Jack! There wasn’t a fence too high or a hedge too thorny to keep us from our adventures. Of course, we’ve had some hard times over the years — especially one particularly rough patch that I’ll share with you later on — but two troublemakers like us always manage to find each other again!\n\nEven though we’re as thick as thieves, we don’t mind a little friendly competition. We’re both men of the sea and love when our work takes us to all corners of the world. Currently, we both trade with a little-known tribe on a faraway island of sulfur and ash. The land is known for its silver — perhaps you’ve even seen some of the silver horseshoes that Barnacle brings back in exchange for exotic fruit. The funny thing is that the islanders don’t even like fruit! They collect it because there’s a special sea breeze there that keeps the fruit fresh and ripe for days and infuses it with a fantastic flavor! The islanders then trade this fruit for what they really want, farm products, and I’m just the man for that. \n\nDon’t get me wrong! Barnacle is a good salesman, but he’s a bit slow on the seas. Thanks to your help, my fruit trade has become more profitable than he could ever imagine!",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn13_copy": "You can’t have a farm without a county fair! Back when Barnacle and I were kids, we would count down the days until the fair arrived in town. Like all the local children, our favorite attraction was the enchanting candy palace, especially the Swirly Slide! We also spent countless hours hiding among the trees and bushes, watching the lions and bears and other wild animals that came with the fair.\n\nThe best ride was by far the Sugar Rush rollercoaster. With a drop of almost 200 feet, you could say that it really kept the good times rolling! One year we dared our friend George to try it, but he was too chicken — just like his favorite pet! \n\nTo prove his bravery, George claimed that he would swim to Great Aunt Willow Island instead, a supposedly enchanted weeping willow atop a small islet in a nearby pond. It’s said that if you sit silently under her branches, Great Aunt Willow will actually speak to you and tell you your path in life. Of course, none of us kids were ever brave enough to find out for ourselves!\n\nBut poor George was so ashamed about the rollercoaster incident that he dived straight into the pond without a second thought! It was only then that he remembered he can’t swim, that silly duck! I jumped in and grabbed him just in the nick of time. After that scare, George and I became the best of friends and promised we would always be there for each other, no matter what life threw our way.",

I’m sure an experienced farmer like you will recognize many of the places and faces I’m about to share. So sit back and relax, and remember: sometimes the truth is even stranger than fiction!\n\nI may be just an old-timer now, but back in my day, I was quite the handsome young swashbuckler with dreams of adventure and grandeur. My twin brother Barnacle and I would navigate the perils of the seven seas from atop our favorite treehouse. You could see everything from up there — even the leviathan of a greenhouse that I live in now! But I loved watching the hustle and bustle of the market most of all.\n\nThings were simpler back then. You could get some fresh popcorn at the market and go on a ride at the county fair for less than a dollar. If I wanted to write a text message, I used my typewriter, and tweets only came from birds! But as they say, the times they are a changin’. Just look at how tremendously our little village has grown since then!\n\nIt’s important that we preserve our local traditions, and the market is surely one of them. Did I tell you that I met the love of my life there? That’s right, even an old salty dog like me has a soft spot for beauty. You should have seen her, with her curly red hair cascading down her shoulders and her green eyes glittering like the aurora borealis on a moonless night, beckoning me to safe harbor. Her stunning beauty may have left me immediately smitten, but it was her famous almond muffins that stole my heart for all eternity.",

In less than a second, you can be sunbathing on the beach or making snow angels. Just don’t forget to exchange your money. I hear the exchange rates are particularly good at the moment.\n\nNot only can us Big Farmers travel to new exotic farms, but the workers over there can also visit us. This is great for business at the organic market. Some of the townsfolk also like to travel for business. You can find that wacky Monty Goldwin all over these days! I’m not a gambling man, but I know that I’ll always get lucky playing his wheel of fortune. Did you know that Monty was born at the county fair? Rumor has it that his father was a strongman. Maybe that’s how he manages to carry that whopper of a wheel with him everywhere!\n\nI’m sure you’ve also noticed our new glass welcome center with the spacious outdoor café. This sky lounge is a great place to meet your friends when they arrive at the farm for the first time. Have you invited any friends to the farm yet?

All he wants in life is to make an honest living on his farm and improve his community. He’s a true blue country boy and the best farmer I know. Unfortunately, however, his advancing age has given him the memory of a goldfish! That’s why I’m over the moon that you’ve inherited his old farm. I know that you’re the one who can return it to its former glory — and more!",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn24_copy": "The Crowleys have always been a thorn in the side of the Big Farm community. Everything's a competition for them, and they can be quite the sore losers when things don’t go their way. Even now, Lester is always at odds with his neighbors. Sometimes it seems like his only friend is his little cat, Bessie.\n\nLester inherited his farm after his father hurt his hip. Unfortunately for Lester, he could never live up to his father’s expectations. His farm paled in comparison to George’s flourishing fields next door, and Lester blamed everyone but himself for his failing crops.\n\nWhen the BigMart came to town, Lester invested his entire savings into its stocks, firmly believing that this megamarket would soon drive the other farms out of business. Unfortunately for him, this plan didn’t play out as he’d hoped. Lester lost everything when the BigMart went bankrupt, and it’s said that he slouched so low that day that you could see straight over his bald head.\n\nLester never recovered from this financial loss. The latest gossip from the rumor mill is that he’s been pilfering goods from the salesman at the organic market to sell to the island farms. Luckily he hasn’t been very successful at this enterprise because he’s always too busy paying bribes to everyone who stumbles upon his rather obvious “secret stash”!",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn22_copy": "You can’t have a village without a post office! A grizzled old sailor such as myself doesn’t get out much, so it always makes my day to hear from old friends. And not only does the post office give farmers the opportunity to share tips and make plans, it also serves as a platform for hearing the latest Big Farm news. Besides, who doesn’t love seeing that white envelope waiting for them in their inbox? \n\nEven if you’re not much of a writer yourself, the post office is a must-see in the cooperative village. As one of the oldest buildings in town, its beauty and functionality are said to be unparalleled. But that’s something Rita Mercury would know better than me!",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn21_copy": "The Coopers were once the wealthiest family in Big Farm. Perhaps you’ve even met Matilda’s nephew, Daniel. His father recently lost the family fortune when he invested all of their assets in Macs. Unfortunately, the apple picking business wasn’t as lucrative as his financial adviser had promised.\n\nDaniel has now taken it upon himself to save the family name with the help of his business savvy wife, Monica Moneybag. Through the combined efforts of their ambitious entrepreneurship, they founded their own company: Fresh Off the Farm, where they provide other companies with goods such as milk, eggs, and anything else that can be produced on a farm. Daniel buys the goods from local farms, while Monica offers a lucrative cash for gold offer to keep their prices low. \n\nThe hard-working couple loves to give back to the community. Their most recent contribution was the new farm laboratory, where enterprising farmers can make their regular products into special new products. As Daniel and Monica say: Success comes in cans, not cannots!",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn002_copy": "Aye, I’m sure a clever farmer like you already knows who my mysterious sweetheart must be. That’s right, it’s the marvelous Matilda MacMuffin! I can still remember the first time our eyes locked: a jolt akin to a jellyfish sting passed right through me! For weeks, I tried to work up the courage to tell her how I felt. Every day, I swore that I would ask for her number, but the only thing I could ever bring myself to ask for was another almond muffin! I tell you, I was as round as a muffin myself by the end of that summer!\n\nAfter months of patiently suffering my lovestruck antics, Matilda simply took it upon herself to ask if I’d like to join her for a walk along the harbor. At the end of our first date, I bought and released 100 heart balloons into the air for her. Rumor has it that you can still find a few floating around from time to time…\n\nWe may have been on cloud nine, but there was a dark cloud on the horizon, too. As the town matriarch, Margaret Cooper took it upon herself to get involved in everyone’s business, especially her daughter’s. She loved Matilda and wanted only the best for her — unfortunately, “the best” meant aspiring doctors and bankers, not a simple sailor like me.\n\nMargaret forbade Matilda from seeing me, but of course you can’t cage up two young lovebirds for long. Matilda and I began to sneak away from home for midnight rendezvous in the farthest corners of the farm: the lighthouse, under the bridge, even in a swan paddle boat on the pond! Thanks to the help of our good friend George, our romance remained a secret.\n\nBut all good things must come to an end. I wasn’t the only one completely enraptured by Matilda, of course. That ill-tempered Lester Crowley also had an eye on her — and her mother’s fortune. As George’s neighbor, it didn’t take him long to sniff out George’s new preoccupation with envelopes and the post office. One day, he snatched up an envelope that George had forgotten on his front porch and ran home to concoct a wicked plan.\n\nThat night, Matilda and I met at the airport for a romantic picnic under the stars. As I leaned in to kiss her hello, we heard a menacing voice from the bushes.\n\n“You’re in BIG trouble now, you know. I bet Margaret Cooper would love to hear about this!” A dark shape emerged from the shadows.\n\nI recognized the slouched silhouette at once.\n\n“What do you want, Lester?” I tried to keep my voice calm, but inside I knew that our perfect world was only hanging on by a thread, and Lester held the scissors.\n\n“All I want is to see you happy!” He snickered. “Unfortunately, I can be known to run my mouth at times. Perhaps there is a way you could keep me occupied, however...”\n\n“Anything! We’ll do anything!” Matilda cried.\n\nLester grinned from ear to ear. “Then help me destroy George’s farm,” he said.\n\nI looked over at my darling Matilda, her lovely eyes wide with shock. Could I betray my best friend for the woman of my dreams?",

I can still remember the time we held a pretend beauty pageant and she handed me a bouquet of carnations and asked me how it felt to be named the next Miss Big Farm. I was tickled pink!\n\nWhen she was older, Rita spent most of her time at the market, patiently waiting to get wind of the latest gossip. Unfortunately, the only wind she ever got was a fishy breeze from the Mermaid Bay, old Oleg's restaurant! But when she did hear something good, you could be sure that it would be the headline story in the next edition of the town newspaper, The Racing Farmer.\n\nAn inquisitive soul like Rita’s can’t sit still for too long. As soon as she was old enough, she set off to the big city to make a name for herself as a journalist. She landed an internship at BigNews. At first, she only answered phones and picked up coffee, but soon she got her big break: a small flavor piece about a festival in honor of Henrietta the Chicken, a local celebrity known for her impeckable style. Poor Rita was a bundle of nerves! Once she was on camera, she backed straight into the tethers of the huge Henrietta balloon. It took a good five minutes for the cameraman to untangle her. And when he returned to his spot, he saw that his camera was still running — and had broadcasted the fiasco live to the entire city.",

Did you know that she gets her spiritual relationship with nature from her Native American mother? Her father, on the other hand, is descended from nomadic horse people. He taught Lilly to live freely and never be tied down, which is how she has acquired so much knowledge about the flowers of the world. But when Lilly first saw the empty plot that would one day become the flower farm, she knew that it was time to put down her roots.\n\nLilly knows a thing or two about rare plants and is a master of the ancient art of floriculture. She carries on the old traditions passionately, even if it means getting her hands dirty. She loves the environment and strives everyday to create harmony between man and nature. But she isn’t afraid of technological progress either! I’ve heard she has a glog … or maybe it’s called a blog … where she shares all of her secrets to growing the prettiest flowers in town. “Spreading ancient knowledge with modern technology!” That’s what our Lilly always says. We’re all so glad that she has finally stopped to smell the roses here!",

To this day, it is still going swimmingly, and he’s made a real splash in the local community.\n\nIf Barnacle’s not out trading for exotic fruits or having a ball with the cheeky mermaids at the Coveted Cove, you can find him on the front porch of his red shack playing a game of fetch with Miss Tentacle. She is one smart invertebrate, and a perfect match for my Mr. Tentacle. They’re always getting tangled up with each other!\n\nSo take a walk along the shore and enjoy the fresh sea breeze on your face. Grab a fishing pole and try your luck at catching dinner. Or maybe just sit at the edge of the pier and dangle your feet in the water while the fish nibble your toes.

Matilda was my wild rose in a field of thorns, but George was my lighthouse in the storm. I couldn’t imagine life without both of them by my side.\n\nMatilda clasped my hand in hers. “We can’t destroy George’s farm,” she insisted. But the tears in her eyes told a different story. I couldn’t bare to see her suffer like this.\n\n“No, it’s the only way, darling.” I wrapped my arms around her tightly. “I can’t imagine a life away from you.”\n\nShe sighed deeply. “All's fair in love and war.”\n\nThe next night, we waited for Lester outside of George’s farm as agreed. Matilda sat by the fence with her face cupped in her hands while I paced like an animal in a cage. I hadn’t slept a wink the night before and just wanted to get it over with. Suddenly, a small, chirpy voice piped up behind us.\n\n“What are you two doing here?” A freckled, orange-haired girl in a canary yellow sweater peered at us through the fence, clutching a blue notebook tightly in her fist.\n\nMatilda jumped with fright. “Rita!” She shouted. “What on earth are you doing out this late at night?”\n\n“I heard footsteps and just had to know what’s going on! I need a juicy story for my newspaper. So spill the beans!” Rita sat with her pen poised above her notebook, ready to reveal our secret to the world.\n\n“We’re just ...uh… looking at the ...um… stars,” I scrambled for words.\n\nRita scribbled furiously. “On George’s farm?”\n\n“Yes,” Matilda chimed in. “He has the best view.”\n\n“Oh!” Rita exclaimed. “My readers would just love to know that. I’d better get home and start writing!”\n\nMatilda and I shared a look of panic. Suddenly, it hit me what we were doing out here. How could we have ever considered hurting our best friend, the one who had made our romance possible in the first place?\n\n“This isn’t right,” I said. “I have to go.”\n\n“Yes!” she grabbed my hand. “I’m coming with you.”\n\n“No, darling,” I pulled my hand out of hers. “I mean I have to go. Far away. Alone. Look at what I’ve become: I was only one second away from betraying my best friend!”\n\n“No, you can’t!” Matilda pleaded. “I need you here — the town needs you here!”\n\n“Not if I’m going to destroy it! You would all be better off without me. I’ll set sail at first light.” I choked back tears and walked away.\n\nShe ran after me, tears streaming down her flushed cheeks. “Just one last night,” she pleaded breathlessly.\n\nI took her in my arms and kissed her hard. “I love you so much, Matilda.” I sat with her on the meadow of flowers below, losing myself in her arms as the sweet scent of lavender washed over us. But tomorrow always comes too soon. As the first rays of dawn broke across the purple sky, I freed myself from Matilda’s sleeping embrace and slipped away to the harbor.\n\nThat day, we parted ways believing we would never see each other again, but life always has a funny way of surprising you...",

Here at Big Farm, we like to share hard work — and the rewards we get as a result. The town council purchases the machines for all the local farmers to share, and one farmer always volunteers to look after their maintenance and upgrading. Back then, it was Matilda, but I hear that Tessa Townsend is doing a fine job of it these days. Have you had your turn at taking care of the machines yet? The hard work pays off when you see all their great advantages!\n\nThe production farm machines are Matilda’s pride and joy. Even though they are only active for a certain time, she loves the low costs and impressive benefits. It’s no surprise that she always uses the farm flash to increase production at her delicious bakery! Personally, I’m a big fan of the retro classic. I love to make people smile, whether with a classic tractor or a good tale.\n\nIn addition, Tessa is such a fan of the production farm machines that she has started offering rewards to anyone who comes by to try one out! And this isn’t just a one-time thing, she is so convinced of the benefits of the machines that she is willing to give out rewards for every day you visit. So if you haven’t taken advantage of this great offer yet, all I can say is: put the pedal to the metal!",

Instead, he swears by a well-equipped toolbox and high-quality grease. This grease also comes in handy for his well groomed mustache, which I hear he brushes and curls several times per day. But don’t mention this to him! I’ve heard it’s a prickly subject.\n\nSteve is a man of few words. Instead, he prefers to express himself through his actions. Every so often, he drives his red minivan up to the farm and puts his best blueprints on display. His dream is to help aspiring farmers upgrade their high level buildings to new heights and capacities. When it comes to quality construction, old Steve never screws around!",

It’s a shame, because for a small fee of dollars or gold, you can trek far into the depths of the caverns to extract twice as many dollars or gold from the rocks. Now that’s what I call a good bang for your buck! Of course, this is a dangerous job and not for the faint of heart, so first you have to prove your skills by earning a mining license via production in the mill or a prime day sale. \n\nGeorge was the first to discover the old, boarded up mine and return it to working condition again. Unfortunately he didn’t find any precious stones the size of chickens as he had hoped — but the mounds of gold and dollars he did find definitely made up for that!",

  "CoopSmugglerYarn004_copy": "Leaving Matilda was the hardest thing I had ever done in my life. I sailed from port to port, trying to forget our time together, but the memories always followed in my wake. At night, I would lie in my hammock and stare at the blanket of stars above. For me, each star represented a certain memory I shared with my Matilda. There was us running through a field of goldflowers, carving our initials into the cooperative tree, or watching the sun set a crimson gold over the navy blue waters. I imagined her looking up at the same sky and reliving the same memories, and in that moment, I knew that even if our bodies could not be together, nothing would keep our hearts apart.\n\nWanting only to be alone and forget my heartbreak, I built a little hut on a remote island where no one could find me — save for a few pesky lemurs. Several years later, to my great surprise, a passing supply airplane attached a stained, yellowing envelope to my daily copy of the Racing Farmer. The letter was from none other than Steve Screwdriver, Matilda’s younger brother! I tore it open at once, terrified of what I would find, but also desperate to receive any news on my long lost sweetheart.\n\nWhat I read left me in such a state of shock that you could have knocked me over with a peacock feather:\n\nDear Yarnacle,\n\nI’m afraid I got some awful news. Matilda had a bad accident in the garage and is in a coma now! The doctors said her prospects don’t look so good.\n\nAnd that ain’t the only thing I have to tell you: after the accident, I discovered something very strange. I was feeling blue, so I went for a walk into the mine and stumbled upon a pile of your old stuff! Suddenly I heard footsteps and ducked behind a rock. Can you guess who I saw then? You! Or so I thought … \n\nI asked what in the world you were doing there, and you got this guilty look on your face and confessed everything. It wasn’t “you” at all, but rather your twin brother, Barnacle, who has been pretending to be you, Yarnacle, for all these years!\n\nI can only imagine the reason Barnacle is dressing as you is so he can help care for your little daughter, Eva. You should really see her: her cheeks are rosier than the reddest apples.\n\nPlease come home to set the story straight and see Matilda before it’s too late!\n\nBest,\nSteve\n\nMy head began to swim and I collapsed onto my cot. What a triple whammy to my senses! A million thoughts raced through my head like the winds of a sea storm. I have a daughter? Barnacle is dressing as me? Will I ever see my precious Matilda alive again? But out of all those tumultuous thoughts, one feeling rose above the chaos of my mind to where my thinking was calm and clear: I must go home. I must see Big Farm again.",

  "CoopSmugglerYarn51_copy": "I’m sure you’ve heard Barnacle brag about his clever little pet, Miss Tentacle. She’s learned all the ropes when it comes to navigating, and Barnacle claims she can even take the helm while he catches a wink.\n\nMiss Tentacle hasn’t left Barnacle’s side since that fateful day on the dock. But always one to spin a yarn, Barnacle concocted his own fanciful tale of how she fell into his arms: when he pulled her from the bone-crushing clutches of a giant kraken in the Bermuda Triangle! Who would believe such a far-fetched tale?!\n\nAs fate would have it, I met my own eight-tentacled companion, Mr. Tentacle, not long after. And the tale of how I encountered this red-and-white striped fellow is the honest truth, sailor’s honor!\n\nI was helping my old pal Oleg fish for some mahi-mahi, and just as I nodded off during another one of his long-winded stories about his pet goldfish, Silvy, the pole jumped clean out of my hands! Luckily, Oleg grabbed it just in time to save it from a watery grave. It took all of our combined strength to reel the beast in. We peered over the edge of the boat to set eyes on the big catch — and came face to face with a great white shark! And boy, was this guy mad! He thrashed and twisted in the water, snapping his powerful jaws at us the entire time.\n\nOleg and I were at a loss — how could we free the creature if we couldn’t get him to calm down long enough for us to remove the fishing hook? But our prayers were answered with a sudden flash of red and white. Tentacles flew as a plump little octopus pummeled the great white from every direction. When the beast finally calmed, Oleg retrieved his hook and we set the monstrosity free again. I offered the eight-tentacled fury some freshly caught fish as a thank you, and what would you know, he wanted even more — and hasn’t left my shoulder since!",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn52_copy": "Contrary to his namesake, Johnny Appleseed, Johnny wouldn’t be caught dead in a tin hat — and has never planted an apple tree his entire life! Instead, Johnny prefers to leave the hard work to others while he relaxes in his hammock. Nonetheless, the boy has quite the nose for good business opportunities!\n\nPerhaps you’ve sipped a tangy Orange Fizz at his island beach bar, or enjoyed a bite of his famous cotton candy at the county fair, where he’s said to be building the biggest candy palace the world has ever seen!\n\nIt’s widely believed that Johnny’s successful business sense must have come from his father, a traveling salesman who couldn’t raise little Johnny after his mother passed away. Matilda saw their struggle and offered to raise Johnny as one of her own. He’s been a part of the family ever since, even if he does sometimes tease Eva until her face is the color of a red delicious!\n\nJohnny has to travel a lot these days to manage all his businesses. Thankfully, he’s not alone! He met the apple to his pie not long ago when she flew to the island farm to help Johnny with a pesky lemur problem. This fellow animal lover with a penchant for pink pigs has stayed by his side ever since…",

  "CoopSmugglerYarn005_copy": "My ship whipped across the waves like a wild wind! Finally, I was going home! But no matter how fast I raced across the seas, my heart always raced faster. I longed to catch that first glimpse of the lighthouse in the fog, to step off the pier and onto the soft grass below, and to smell the spicy and delectable aromas of the market. But most of all, I couldn’t wait to see Matilda and my daughter, Eva, and set the story straight with Barnacle! \n\nDark clouds began to roll in over the farm as I anchored my ship and rowed my dinghy to the pier. Goosebumps popped up along my arms as the electricity in the air began to rise. I knew a real devil of a storm could break loose at any moment … and I would be caught in the middle of it.\n\nI hoisted myself onto the dock, stood up, and felt like my heart would jump straight out of my chest! There I saw … myself. It was as if someone had placed a mirror in the middle of the pier, but this mirror had given my reflection an old, stiff captain's outfit and a ridiculous beard!\n\n“I knew this day would come.” The strange reflection put his arm on my shoulder.\n\nI pushed him away from me. “Barnacle! My brother, the betrayer!”\n\n“Yarnacle, listen…” Barnacle walked toward me. Thunder rumbled in the distance.\n\n“Get back, you black-hearted landlubber!” I raised my fists. “Don’t you come one step closer!”\n\nA bolt of lightning cracked over our heads and thunder echoed across the harbor. I saw a look of desperation cross Barnacle’s face as he walked toward me. “Yarnacle, you wouldn’t…”\n\nAll of a sudden, something wet plopped between our feet. A cool and slimy tentacle caressed my toes.\n\n“What the…?” Barnacle and I yelled in unison. He bent over and picked up a squirming ball of what appeared to be purple jelly. \n\n“Why, what do we have here?” He asked with a grin. A small violet octopus wrapped her tentacle around his arm and dangled from it like an expert acrobat.\n\nI couldn’t help myself: gales of laughter swept over me like a stormwind. Soon Barnacle was also clutching his belly, tears streaming down his face. Just like when we were kids. The menacing clouds finally broke open, pouring rain upon us and making us laugh even harder.\n\nOnce he had caught his breath, Barnacle turned to me with a solemn look on his face: “After Eva was born, I tried to contact you. I wrote a letter every day for a year! But I never heard back. Matilda was devastated; she was in no state to care for Eva or her new adoptive son, Johnny. Slowly, it dawned on me what I had to do — I had to be you.  Of course I felt awful about it, but I knew it was the right thing to do.” The octopus climbed her way up to his shoulder, but he didn’t even notice.\n\n“I told everyone that I was setting off on another grand adventure, anchored my ship in the nearest cove, and swam back in your old captain uniform. I told them that I...you...had gotten caught in a terrible storm and the ship had capsized. Despite all odds, you found the strength to fight the seas all the way back to your home, Big Farm.” Barnacle pushed away a curious tentacle that wanted to become friends with his beard.\n\n“You should have seen Matilda’s face — like a million rays of sunshine bursting through a storm cloud. But you can’t tell her the truth now: in her state, it could kill her!” Barnacle seized my hand. “Yarnacle, promise me you won’t tell her!”\n\nI couldn’t think, couldn’t speak, couldn’t do anything but watch this silly little octopus wiggle her way over to Barnacle’s other shoulder.\n\nMy trance was broken as the small, high-pitched voice of Rita Mercury carried across the pier: “Matilda is awake! Come back, quick!”",

  "CoopSmugglerYarn71_copy": "With its sprawling training grounds and impressive stables, the horse ranch sure is hard to miss these days! But this wasn’t always the case. Back in the day, the horse ranch had just one stable and riding arena and was maintained entirely by its patrons, like my daughter Eva. Not too long ago, however, a young firecracker by the name of Rose McLundy rode into town with big winnings and even bigger plans: to take over the property and make it into a proper horse ranch for training and competitions!\n\nYou wouldn’t believe how many locals have already participated in the tournaments! If you need a good laugh, just watch George on the show jumping track: it’s a miracle that he and his horse, Minnie, could ever win with all that horsing around they do! Even cranky old Lester saddles up Dusty for a quick test of her dressage skills — much to the chagrin of his cat, Bessie, who prefers to have his attention all to herself. When she’s feeling particularly neglected, she jumps straight into the middle of the riding circle to give the horses a proper fright!\n\nAnyone can participate in the horse competitions and tournaments! Just use your hard-earned horseshoes to train your horse and then put him to the test. And if, like me, one horse isn’t enough, you can buy more from the horse market or breed the ones you already have.\n\nWhat’s that you say? You haven’t visited the horse ranch yet? Then quit stalling and hoof it down there before you miss any more great opportunities!",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn61_copy": "Have you heard the news about the grand reopening of the farm academy? It made the front page of the Racing Farmer! That school is Matilda’s pride and joy. She laid the foundations for it with her own two hands and has been hard at work upgrading and expanding it ever since. If there’s anything Matilda loves as much as gardening and farming, it’s teaching! She tends to the education of her pupils just as lovingly as she tends to her mushrooms, ensuring that they always grow and thrive.\n\nYou wouldn’t believe how many bright young farmers out there are eager to gain experience in this important industry! Matilda’s investment has definitely paid off: not only is the school open to everyone in town, but it’s also got a bright future ahead of it thanks to generous donors like you!",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn72_copy": "With her girlish features and boundless energy, it’s hard to believe that our sweet Rose is already a young lady in her 20s! After graduating from college, she entered her horse, Goldy, into a local equestrian tournament — and won! Rose decided to invest her winnings into starting up her own horse ranch, and Big Farm was just the place to do it.\n\nEva, head rancher at the time, gave Rose a warm welcome and gladly handed her the reins to the ranch. Rose needed more help to get started, though. That’s why all of us townsfolk have chipped in to help her build and upgrade the necessary facilities. Not only do we want to see her succeed, but the financial investment also pays off when you see how many competitors the tournaments bring in! \n\nEven though Rose is a diligent and dedicated worker, she loves to have some fun as well. Her favorite holiday is Valentine’s Day, and every year she plans a surprise for her sweetheart — a surprise big enough for the entire farm to enjoy!",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn63_copy": "Not a day goes by that Tessa doesn’t appear with a new task, mission, or clever community event. In fact, with all her activities, some might even say that she’s the face of Big Farm!\n\nEven though Tessa was born here and attended the farm academy for her first years of grade school, she moved to the city at a young age when her dad landed a job as a sales liaison for Fresh Off the Farm. Tessa grew into a successful business woman, enjoyed a great career, and achieved everything she set out to get. Nonetheless, she always felt incomplete, like something — or someone — was missing.\n\nTessa dropped everything and moved back to her childhood home in Big Farm. She used her savvy business skills to enter into an up-and-coming niche market: raising home-grown, organic beef.\n\nTessa is committed to her work, but her passion is improving the wellbeing of her community. Tessa cares deeply about the happiness of her neighbors and serves as chairwoman of the local decoration committee. In her words: you can’t put a price on happiness!\n\nLike Benny, Tessa claims to have no time for a husband or family. But I know I’m not the only one who has seen the way those two look at each other...",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn62_copy": "I’m sure you’ve met Benny by now! If he’s not getting his hands dirty in the fields, you can catch him adding a fresh coat of red paint to the barn. He throws himself into every task headfirst and isn’t afraid to tackle new challenges. Benny isn’t the type to come up with new ideas himself, however. Even though he’s handy with tools, he’s not the sharpest tool in the shed when it comes to innovation. Nonetheless, everyone on the farm loves him — especially the ladies, if all the scuttlebutt around here is true!\n\nBenny’s father was a salesman and taught Benny to always show his best side. Benny applied this to his work but never aspired to join his father in the 9 to 5 grind. He loves the great outdoors and could never stomach a boring office job. He was one of Matilda’s most diligent and attentive students at the farm academy and visits her on a regular basis to help her with her garden. His Hawaiian cousin, Lana, has also been known to visit the farm from time-to-time to add a touch of Hawaiian flair, make some delicious ice cream, or even build her own snowman family!\n\nBenny is one of the most eligible bachelors in Big Farm — you can see why with that pearly white smile — but he doesn’t seem to know it. When one of the ladies asks him to a Sadie Hawkins dance, he simply smiles shyly and claims that he’s already married to his work. Young fool, if you ask me!\n\nOf course, now that Tessa Townsend is back in town, rumor has it that his days as a bachelor are numbered...",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn007_copy": "Matilda’s eyes fluttered open. She sat up on her cot and gazed at the familiar posters and photos that adorned the farm academy wall. Finally she mustered the courage to peek at me out of the corner of her eye.\n\n“Who … who are you?” Her face was as white as if she had just seen a ghost. “I don’t understand this…”\n\n“Please relax, darling,” I stroked her hand with my thumb. “There is so much you don’t know.”\n\n“Then tell me.” She took a deep breath and locked her eyes with mine. “I’m ready.” \n\nSo I told her everything, from my first day out at sea, to the letter from Steve, to my confrontation with Barnacle the night she woke from her coma. And then I confessed how much I had missed her, how no other woman could hold a candle to her, how she was my sun and moon and everything in-between, and how I simply could not live another day without her.\n\nI was relieved to see color returning to her cheeks, but I needed to hear her voice, too.\n\n“Matilda, please understand,” I begged. “Please say something, anything!”\n\nShe paused for a long moment. “I love you,” she whispered.\n\nMeanwhile, completely unbeknownst to us, a now older but just as inquisitive Rita Mercury had crouched outside the window and was listening attentively to every word I said. She ran off to share this exciting news with her best friend, Eva, who busy training her horses at the Big Farm horse ranch. This was before the ranch belonged to Rose, of course.\n\nEva was completely floored when she heard the news. Teenage girls are said to be drawn to drama, but even this was too much for her to bear. I suppose she inherited her mother’s disposition in that regard. However, unlike her mother, Eva was not quick to forgive and forget. \n\nEnraged, Eva ran home and tossed her favorite organic jackets and polished stone jewelry into her hand-sewn cotton knapsack. Rita begged her to calm down. “This is good news!” she repeated over and over again.\n\nEva laughed at this remark and continued her packing.\n\n“At least tell me where you’re going,” Rita pleaded.\n\n“Up north!” Eva snapped. She hopped on her favorite horse, Misty, and they galloped straight for the harbor. You won’t believe the next part of this story, but I swear by Poseidon’s trident that it’s true! Eva sailed off with the only boat in the harbor — and who do you think that rusty bucket belonged to? That’s right, ol’ Yarnacle! I must admit, even though I was shocked by this stunt, I couldn’t help but be proud that my Eva was a chip off the old block!\n\nWhile all of this was happening, Matilda and I were in the farm academy, completely oblivious to the outside world. For the first time in decades, I felt my heart overflowing with love. If only I had known how fleeting this feeling could be.\n\nRita barged in the front door, out of breath and covered in a thin sheen of sweat.\n\n“Eva … north...” she gasped and frantically gestured out the window toward the turquoise sea.\n\nMatilda and I shared a quizzical look. “What’s going on, Rita?” she asked.\n\n“Eva is gone!” Rita stammered. “She … she ran away!”\n\nMatilda clutched her heart and collapsed onto the cot. I fell to my knees by her side, crying her name, but she remained completely unresponsive. I grabbed her wrist, but her pulse was only a light flutter, barely perceptible under my calloused fingers.\n\n“Rita!” I shouted. “Get the doctor immediately. Matilda’s dying!”",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn006_copy": "Matilda is awake! Every cell of my body longed to run to her side, to hold her beautiful face in my hands, to stroke that fiery hair.\n\nBarnacle caught my eye. “She can’t find out about you. The shock would kill her.” I ran past him, but he grabbed my arm firmly. “Yarnacle, promise me you won’t tell her!”\n\nI jerked my hand away but didn’t try to run further. As much as it pained me to admit, I knew he was right. I took one last look at the shore — there was the old flagpole where Matilda and I once tried to carve our initials, the bench where I told Matilda that I loved her, even that old rundown red shack where we shared our first midnight rendezvous. I turned away, blinking back tears, and slowly got back into my dinghy.\n\nI looked up at my brother, and despite the cold rain and my even colder heart, I felt the warm tides of fraternal love wash over me. “I promise I won’t tell her,” I sighed. “Take care of her, brother.” I pushed the dinghy off the dock. Goodbye, Big Farm. Goodbye, Matilda.\n\nAs the years passed, the memories began to fade, but the pain remained just as sharp. I couldn’t distract myself as I had before. This time I needed to be a part of my family’s life, even if it had to remain a secret. I contacted Steve Screwdriver and asked for his help. We concocted a tale about a lonely adventurer, Redbeard, in need of some penpals on the mainland. Steve would read Redbeard’s gripping tales of adventure to Matilda and Eva and send me their serene accounts of farm life in return. In this way, I finally got a chance to learn all about my precious little Eva and reconnect to my dear Matilda, even if she never knew it.\n\nThose years were the longest and hardest of my life. They say that time heals all wounds, but some wounds are simply too deep. I traveled to every corner of the world, trying to escape my pain, but it followed me like a dark shadow. My beard grew long and wild, and my hair would have made a fine nest for one of the many seabirds trailing my ship. Finally, I couldn’t take it anymore! I knew I had made a promise to Barnacle, but I was determined to see my family now, no matter the cost. So I threw all caution to the wind and set sail for home!\n\nI knew exactly where to go: Matilda’s new farm academy. She had told “Redbeard” all about it in her letters. I landed on shore and hid myself behind a large tree across the way from the academy. Two rambunctious youngsters shouted and laughed as they chased each other in a good-natured game of tag. Suddenly my breath caught in my throat as the school’s double doors swung open. Matilda stepped out into the sunshine, a little rounder in the middle and grayer on the top, but still as beautiful as the first time I laid eyes on her. For one moment, the world stood completely still, and I felt at peace.\n\n“Oof!” I cried as something hard and round plowed straight into my belly. One of those two youngsters, a small but wiry boy, fell flat onto his back, a shock of black hair falling straight into his eyes.\n\n“Sorry, mister!” Young Benny Buddler said. “Tessa was right behind me and I wasn’t lookin’ where I was goin’.”\n\n“I’d say so!” I laughed as I helped him back onto his feet. “You ran smack dab into me, little fella!”\n\nSuddenly Benny’s eyes flew to something behind me. “I didn’t know he was there, Miss Matilda!” he exclaimed.\n\nMy heart stopped beating. My legs turned to jelly. It took every ounce of strength in my body just to turn around and finally face my sweetheart again.\n\n“Matilda, darling, listen — ,” was all I managed before she fainted into my arms.",

Everywhere she went, the new nickname “Rattlebrained Rita” followed her.\n\nDesperate to feel normal again, Rita returned to the only place she knew where no one owned a television set: Big Farm. The Racing Farmer was glad to have her back and exactly as she had left it, perhaps just a bit dustier. It only took her one day to collect all the news she had missed over the past few months and publish it! To be fair, this news only included a report on the latest crop circles and some photos of painted eggs from the craft workshop at the preschool, but it was good to know nonetheless! Rita was thrilled to be in her element again, and we were pleased as punch to have her back!\n\nEven if country-living isn’t as fast-paced and exciting as big city life, Rita can always make a mountain out of a molehill for her articles.

  "CoopSmugglerYarn91_copy": "Due to the frequent monsoon seasons, the island farm had never been settled for long: until Johnny Apple showed up. Not afraid of a little rain, he saw this as an incredible opportunity to finally make his dream a reality: by building his very own beach bar with original, homemade cocktails and live guitar music.\n\nSo Johnny got to work cultivating the fields and sowing his favorite crops: oranges, peanuts, and grapes. Not long after, he planted orchards for coconuts, bananas, and even mangoes! It’s amazing he was even able to harvest a thing with all the snacking he did, but soon he had collected enough fresh fruit to start making his own delicious cocktails. With names like Tropic Star, Fruity Flip, and Summer Slush, you’d think he had just as much fun coming up with the names of the drinks as he did their recipes!\n\nIn the evenings, Johnny would sit in his comfy hammock and strum some relaxing tunes on his guitar. His favorite themes were the sea, the sand, and the mosquitoes. The melodic music caught the attention of the local lemur population, and it wasn’t long until the bar was overrun by an entire conspiracy of lemurs! Johnny knew he had to get these leaping lemurs under control before the tourists arrived, so he called the only veterinarian he knew: Vicky Ventura.",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn121_copy": "Have you heard reports of strange happenings during the night? Or perhaps you’ve seen some unusual occurrences yourself? Concentric circles cut into the crops, cows gone missing, even parts of a mysterious aircraft turning up in the middle of fields? Some of my more gullible neighbors claim that flying saucers are behind all of this — but the only unidentified flying objects that I’ve seen are the countless footballs and baseballs that fly into my backyard!\n\nNonetheless, the cleverest twins in Big Farm, Jim &amp; Jack, have taken it upon themselves to solve this mystery, even if it means pestering every farmer around. I don’t mind seeing Lester get his feathers ruffled, but poor George believes everything the boys tell him — to the point that he harvested all his corn just so the boys could find an “unidentified creature” hidden among the stalks (it was the scarecrow, of course).\n\nJim and Jack are nice lads, albeit rather mischievous at times. Jim is a pleasant boy who loves animals and giving gifts to his neighbors. Despite his big heart, however, he easily gets caught up in his brother Jack’s schemes. Always the little troublemaker, Jack enjoys playing pranks on all his neighbors. Perhaps you’ve even encountered some of his “work” on your own farm.\n\nNext time you hear reports about strange happenings in Big Farm, or experience something unusual for yourself, track down Jim &amp; Jack. If they aren’t behind it themselves, they can find out who — or what — is.\n\nBut if you want my two cents, it’s all a bunch of hogwash. I would bet my bottom dollar that those strange lights that Eva saw were nothing but a plain old weather balloon!",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn112_copy": "Omar has collected the most incredible array of goods from his world travels. From tropical islands to the icy north, there’s nowhere he won’t go to find the greatest deals. Omar isn’t afraid of adventure, and like me, he has collected a wealth of fascinating tales. For example, have you heard about the time that Omar saved Oleg’s life?\n\nIt was a stormy day on the island farm — the first fat raindrops had already begun to fall, and Johnny and Vicky were hard at work packing up the beach bar. Omar wanted to reach the viking farm before the monsoon hit, and he was making great speed thanks to the strong wind at his back. Oleg was also taking advantage of the windy weather: the great waves stirred up the water, causing the fish to jump practically straight into his boat. But the more fish he caught, the more he wanted, and soon he was leaning over the railing, holding up his net like a parachute for the fish to jump into. Suddenly, a great, rolling wave tipped the boat and sent Oleg plunging headfirst into the treacherous waters.\n\nOmar heard Oleg’s cries for help and sailed over as fast as he could. He dived into the choppy water — an especially agile swimmer for his age and girth — and pulled Oleg back onto his fishing boat. Oleg was so grateful that he gave Omar all of his catch for the day, and the two have been best mates ever since.\n\nOleg is all that Omar has now. He once had a wife and son back in Big Farm, but after his wife passed away, his job and world travels made it impossible for him to take care of the lad. Luckily, the sweetest lady in town gladly took in the boy as her own. Omar often visits his son on his island farm, but he hasn’t yet mustered up the courage to reveal the true nature of their relationship…",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn123_copy": "One trip inside the red brick walls of the Big Farm library won’t only boost your spirit, but also production on your farms! Take a stroll along the halls of handbooks, and you will find something useful for every farm, no matter how near or far.\n\nFurthermore, these handbooks are no ordinary books. Pay a little extra gold to level them up, and you will reap what you sow — literally! If you don’t trust me, just ask Professor James the next time he comes to visit. He spends almost all his days in the library, poring over ancient Mayan manuscripts and diligently copying their handbooks word for word. He knows the value of a good handbook and would love to help you out, if you don’t mind giving a small donation to his research on ancient civilizations.\n\nThe library was built by the first Big Farm settlers, including Nils’ viking ancestors. So it’s no surprise that although they were simple farmers, they understood the value of a good education. They knew that buying a handbook for every crop, animal, and product on the farm would pay for itself in the end. Just take a look at how large and successful the town of Big Farm has become, and you will see for yourself how right they are!",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn122_copy": "If there’s one thing that every farm in Big Farm has in common, it’s the cooperative tree. Its branches tower above all else on the farm, providing welcome shade to any visitor wishing to enjoy tranquil solitude on the bench below. Furthermore, it’s said that a couple who carves their initials into the bark will stay together forever, and Matilda and I are living proof!\n\nEven though all of us here in Big Farm belong to the same warm and welcoming community, we also need a little extra support from our closest friends and neighbors. Cooperatives provide the perfect opportunity to contribute directly to the success of your fellow farmers, and to receive some help if you need it. Plus, if you like taking part in the occasional competition to spice up your daily work, join the cooperative championship and prove your good reputation!\n\nLike any plant, the cooperative tree needs water to grow. You should visit your thirsty tree every day to give it a drink. Your tree will thank you for it! When its blossoms come into full bloom, you can collect a variety of useful items that drop from its branches. Remember, sharing is caring! These items will come in handy for your cooperative’s projects. And if a fellow cooperative member visits your farm or simply wants to say thank you for being a friend, he or she can water your cooperative tree as well, increasing its harvest.\n\nTogether, we can achieve great things!",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn111_copy": "Not many men these days have true viking blood pumping through their veins! Nils has been fascinated by his heritage since his mother gave him his first viking tunic at the age of three. By six, he had already grown a full beard, and by nine, he was ready to sail his first longship!\n\nNils was always eager to learn more. At Tundra University, he studied the lives and cultures of the first viking clans. With his degree in Vikingology nestled securely under his belt, he jumped into his longship and set sail to the old viking island. There he wanted to prove once and for all that he could recreate the lives of the vikings for himself - and even make a profit while he was at it.\n\nUnfortunately, Nils forgot to take the ice storms into account, and he lost everything after only 30 days. But did that slow him down? Of course not! He simply saved his snow dollars and started rebuilding as soon as the ice had melted.\n\nAll of this building and rebuilding has taken its toll on Nils’ back, however. He can’t even lift his mallet without feeling pain now. I’m sure some rest would help, but Nils is the type who never takes a break. If he’s not out in the fields harvesting flax or up at the North Cape studying the mating habits of polar bears, you can find him picking apples with his wife Eva. Nils is surely a son-in-law that any father would be proud of!",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn81_copy": "The weather at the Big Farm harbor is always sunny and clear, but the island farm isn’t nearly as lucky. Johnny found this out the hard way when he built (and then lost) his first beach bar, and since then he has learned to keep business profitable by always planning ahead.\n\nFor example, even though Johnny and the other island farm inhabitants have to evacuate at the start of every monsoon season, all the building materials and farm products they leave behind get turned into seashells! Now that is one crazy — and profitable — storm!\n\nJohnny is also skilled at forecasting when the next monsoon will hit. According to him, it appears like clockwork every 30 days. He even claims to have developed his own countdown. Now if only love could be this predictable...\n\nAll of this is important to know if you ever feel yourself craving some hot beaches and cool drinks at Johnny’s island farm. Remember to stay safe, stay smart, and run as soon as you feel the first raindrop!",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn113_copy": "The young minds of Big Farm may learn the ins and outs of agriculture from Matilda’s beloved farm academy, but what should they do if they get lost hiking the numerous trails surrounding the farm? Thankfully, Tessa organized her own scout troop for this very reason. She loves to take the kids out camping in the Big Farm wilderness, even if they sometimes only get as far as George’s farm!\n\nThe scouts’ map doesn’t only teach them the importance of a proper compass, it is also key to finding the best decorations for your farm. Of course, you’ll have to complete some tasks along the way if you want to snatch up some of these delightful decorations for yourself. And after completing a challenging task, there’s no better way to relax than by plopping down on a sturdy log next to the campfire and roasting some super-sized marshmallows — as long as you remember to keep your eyes open for wild boars!",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn92_copy": "Did you know that Vicky grew up in a circus? That’s where she discovered her love for animals. Her first job was caring for baby elephants, and she’s been learning on the job ever since.\n\nNot only is Vicky the most skilled vet in all of Big Farm, but she also looks after many of her own pets on the farmyard she restored herself. Perhaps you’re acquainted with one of her favorites, a teacup pig by the name of Piggles. He’s been under the weather quite frequently as of late, but Vicky always nurtures him back to health — with a little help from her friends like you, of course!\n\nI have to admit, I was a bit surprised when I first heard that Johnny and Vicky were in love. A very unlikely couple, if you ask me. He’s so laid-back, carefree, and — let’s be honest — not the most motivated of workers. Vicky, on the other hand, is a spirited, talented, and diligent worker who always puts the needs of her animals before her own. \n\nAs soon as Vicky heard Johnny’s plea for help, she packed up her things (including Piggles, of course) and traveled to his tropical island to help him find a solution to his pesky lemur problem. It didn’t take her long to discover that the best way to distract lemurs was by giving them tasty fruit to eat. She just wishes they had more!\n\nEven after peace and quiet was restored to the island, at least temporarily, Vicky wasn’t ready to return home just yet. At first, she told herself that it was only the crystal clear waters and hot temperatures that kept her there, but soon she noticed a warm and fuzzy feeling in her heart as well — especially when Johnny was around.",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn101_copy": "Even though ol’ Oleg is by no means new to the Big Farm community, many farmers first met him only recently when he opened up his own fishing &amp; restaurant business. It’s definitely worth paying him a visit. He knows how to catch every fish under the sun — and sea!\n\nOleg learned everything he knows from his loving father, Oliver. Back when Big Farm barely covered two blocks, Oliver owned a small fishery near the shore. Oliver always dreamed that Oleg would follow in his footsteps and take over the family business one day. Little Oleg loved fishing and practiced daily with his pet goldfish, Silvy, but his heart yearned for adventure, and he didn’t want to be tied down by the responsibility of the fishery. One day, he ran away from home and set sail for deep waters to test his luck at catching the “reel” big fish.\n\nMany years later, Oleg received a letter from his friend Omar informing him that his father had died and that the fishery had been demolished. Suddenly Oleg regretted his many years out at sea and raced home as fast as his trawler Silvy would carry him. On the way, it dawned on him that there was only one way to ease his guilt: open a new fishery in his father’s honor.\n\nUnfortunately, Oleg’s fondness for returning his finned friends back to the sea had left him with no money for opening a fishery. All he had was his old boat and the fishing gear his father had given him when he was young. So Oleg decided to finally buckle down and turn his skills into profit, even if it meant saying goodbye to some of his underwater pets. Now he is well on his way to earning enough cash to open his own fishery — and the idea has got him completely hooked!",

  "CoopSmugglerYarn102_copy": "Here on Big Farm, we like to remember and celebrate the simpler times. And what could be more pure and natural than the days before computers, telephones — even electricity? Once upon a time, real vikings inhabited viking island, a small islet not far north of here. Unfortunately, the ice bridge connecting the island to the mainland often melted, which made it difficult to live there permanently and ultimately forced the vikings to emigrate to the Big Farm mainland, where they were among the first settlers to cultivate the fertile land.\n\nThe island remained deserted for many centuries, until a young Nils Nordson came up with a clever business idea: produce authentic viking goods and garb and market them to a modern audience with a desire to reconnect to its past. From rustic viking tankards full of mead to cozy viking coats, Nils knows how to meet the needs of his sophisticated consumers using all-natural, homegrown materials.\n\nNils is concerned with more than profit, however. He also cares deeply about the environment and making the world a better place for future generations. The viking farm boasts numerous pools and pens where Nils and his helpers raise endangered penguins and seals to release back into the wild. While some may find it strange to see penguins at the “north” pole, spend enough time around here and you’ll soon realize that the world map compass has a logic all of its own!",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn011_copy": "I followed Nils to a grove of freshly felled firs — some of the trunks were as thick as the strange rocks I had seen in the stone circle on the shore! Nils handed me the axe.\n\nI struggled to lift the heavy beast. All that time on tropical islands had left me a bit lacking in physical strength, but if my hunch was correct, I wouldn’t have to even break a sweat today.\n\nNils waited to lift his own axe. “Guests first,” he offered and gestured toward a massive log balanced atop a stump.\n\n“No, no. Let’s do it together. That’s only fair,” I replied as I watched him out of the corner of my eye. “On the count of three: 1...2…”\n\n“Wait!” Nils interrupted. “This is ridiculous. An old man like you could strain his back doing something like this!”\n\nI smiled to myself. Just as I had expected: despite his strong exterior, Nils had a weak back.\n\n“It’s clear to me now how much you love Eva,” Nils continued. “I’ll talk to her on your behalf.”\n\n“Thanks so much, Nils. I knew I could count on you,” I patted him lightly on the shoulder.\n\nNils returned shortly with a scowling Eva in tow. She avoided my gaze by pretending to focus on the noisy penguin pool instead.\n\n“Eva,” I caught her eye for a brief second. “We’ve been caught in this web of lies for too long now. I’m going to tell you the truth, and I don’t expect you to forgive me, but I do hope that you will at least understand.” I sat down on a sturdy-looking stump. I motioned for her to do the same. “This might take a while.”\n\nAnd then I told her the whole story, front to back and straight through the middle. Tears welled up in Eva’s eyes when I got to the part about Matilda’s ill health. When I finished, she wiped her eyes and stood up.\n\n“Family comes first,” she said. “Nils, pack our bags. We’re going home!” She hugged me tightly and I felt my heart swell with joy.\n\nNils looked uncomfortable. “Eva, you know I can’t leave the farm. My viking tunic business is finally taking off!”\n\n“But I need you!” Another tear rolled down Eva’s cheek. “You can use your knowledge of ancient Viking herbs to help my mom. Omar can look after the farm for us!”\n\n“Who is Omar?” I asked.\n\n“He’s the oriental salesman who trades special products for the farm,” Nils explained. “You probably saw his boat in the harbor when you arrived. But there’s just one problem: Omar always has a price, and we have nothing left that he would want. Omar prefers exotic goods.” Nils frowned and stroked his beard. “What will we do?”\n\n“You’re in luck!” I laughed. “It just so happens that Barnacle and I just paid a visit to Johnny’s island farm.” I pulled one of the coconuts out of my coat pocket. “We haven’t got much, but maybe we can strike some sort of deal.”\n\nWhile the youngsters packed up their things, I returned to the harbor, where I found Barnacle and Omar in the middle of a heated game of checkers.\n\n“King me!” Barnacle shouted as he smacked the table proudly.\n\nThis gave me a terrific idea. I whispered something in Barnacle’s ear.\n\n“Why don’t we raise the stakes, my friend?” Barnacle proposed.\n\n“I’m listening…” said Omar.\n\n“If you win, you can have my trawler over there.” Barnacle gestured toward the boat, and Omar’s mouth dropped in surprise. “But if I win, you will watch the farm while Eva and Nils take a little vacation.”\n\nOmar couldn’t pass up an offer like that. He agreed without a moment’s hesitation — and without looking down at the checkerboard first.\n\nIn his next move, Barnacle jumped Omar’s last four pieces in one fell swoop.\n\nOmar stared at the board with wide, bewildered eyes. Suddenly he burst into laughter. “Well played, my friend! Good game indeed.”\n\nAt that moment, Eva and Nils ran up with their bags, their breath condensing in the frosty air.\n\n“Can you help us, Omar?” Eva panted. “We have no time to spare!”\n\n“Of course, young lady!” He smiled and patted her shoulder. “Omar is a man of his word.”\n\nWe piled onto Silvy 2, the old lass groaning under our combined weight. Despite her age, she flew like the wind as we left the harbor. I felt the first spark of hope that we would surely beat this race against time and save Matilda. But as fate would have it, my hopes were sent plummeting deep into the sea once more: my map was missing…",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn010_copy": "Barnacle and I set out to find Oleg at once. Time was of the essence, and it was slipping through our fingers faster than the sand on the beach. We found the seasoned fisherman scrubbing the deck of his boat. The word SILVY was painted on the back in bright white letters. Only an eccentric angler like Oleg would ever name his boat after a pet fish!\n\n“Long time no see, ol’ Oleg!” Barnacle hollered up at him from the dock.\n\nOleg’s face broke into a huge grin. “Ahoy, you salty swab! What’re you doing in these parts?”\n\n“We were on our way north but lost our ship and supplies in the storm of the century! Could you lend us a hand … and maybe a boat?” Barnacle laughed.\n\n“Of course! Anything for a fellow seafarer.” Oleg fished in his pocket for a set of keys and tossed them down to us. “Silvy 2 is all patched up and ready to go — just promise me you’ll treat her like your own. I couldn’t bear to lose another Silvy!”\n\n“We will treat her like the princess she is,” Barnacle promised. We climbed aboard Silvy 2, a rusty trawler with peeling white paint, careful to dodge the many lures and lines littering the boat’s cockpit.\n\nJohnny, Vicky, and Oleg waved goodbye as we pulled out of the harbor. We were back on the open sea! Luckily, the storm hadn’t thrown us too far off course. It wasn’t long until the snowy peaks and stone lighthouse of the viking farm came into sight. Barnacle skillfully dodged the floating icebergs and navigated the dilapidated old trawler up to the pier. I breathed in the crisp, cold air, enjoying the rich fragrance of fir trees with a hint of flax and berries.\n\n“Go talk to her, Yarnacle. She needs to hear the truth from you. I’ll wait here,” Barnacle said as he tied the boat to the dock.\n\nI walked toward a snowy cottage with smoke puffing out of a small chimney nestled in its red roof. My heart was pounding so hard that I thought it would jump straight out of my chest! A strapping young fellow with long, wavy blonde hair stopped me at the gate. He took one look at me and frowned.\n\n“Eva doesn’t want to see you,” he said.\n\n“Who are you?” I countered.\n\n“Nils Nordson,” he said matter-of-factly, never breaking eye contact. “Eva’s boyfriend, and a viking-in-training.”\n\n“Nils, listen…” I hoped he would be reasonable. “I need to set things right. I need to tell Eva the truth.”\n\nNils swung a massive stone mallet onto his shoulder. I couldn’t help but notice a flicker of pain cross his face as he did. However, I knew better than to challenge a man with viking blood, even if he was in a weakened state.\n\n“Please go home,” Nils said sternly. “She’ll return when she’s ready.”\n\nOut of the corner of my eye, I spied an axe glinting in the sunlight. At that moment, the most harebrained idea crossed my mind, but it was so crazy that it just might work.\n\n“Nils, you must be quite strong to have built this farm with your own two hands!” I caught a flash of pride on his face. “I’ll tell you what: if you can chop more wood than me in one minute, I’ll go home without another word. But if I can chop more wood than you, you will let me talk to my daughter.”\n\nNils eyed me skeptically.\n\n“No trick,” I assured him. “Do you accept the challenge? Or are you scared of losing to an old man?”\n\nNils squared his shoulders, and another barely perceptible grimace of pain crossed his face. “Challenge accepted,” he said with a self-assured smile.",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn009_copy": "I looked on in horror as the ice cold water encircled my ankles, slowly climbing its way up my legs.\n\n“Help me!” Barnacle shouted as he frantically tossed bucket after bucket of water overboard, oblivious to the fact that the water was already up to our knees.\n\nI grabbed Barnacle by the shoulders and shook him hard. “Brother, it’s too late! We have to get off this boat — NOW!” I yelled.\n\nBarnacle shook me off. “No! A captain always goes down with his ship. Save yourself, Yarnacle. Eva and Matilda need you!” He paused a moment and looked me in the eye. “I’m sorry for everything.”\n\nThe great ship moaned and groaned beneath the pressure of the crashing waves and rising water. I knew her seconds were numbered. I grabbed Barnacle’s arm.\n\n“No, Barnacle! Don’t apologize. I’m the one who should be sorry. You were only trying to help, and all I did was call you names and behave like a petulant child.” I dragged him with me toward the dinghy. “Please come with me! We need to do this together.” I stopped to look at him. “I love you, brother.”\n\nBarnacle grabbed my other arm and locked eyes with me. “I love you, too. I’m so sorry.” He hugged me in a tight embrace. “Come on, let’s go!”\n\nWe sloshed our way over to the thankfully still intact dinghy and scrambled in, much to the relief of Mr. and Miss Tentacle, who had plastered themselves to our shoulders in fright. As we rowed away from the sinking ship, the skies cleared and the sea calmed. Finally safe, Barnacle and I looked at each other and laughed. What a crazy mess!\n\n“What now?” I asked. “We lost everything: our map, our food, our water.”\n\n“Don’t worry,” Barnacle smiled as he rowed against the waves. “My son Johnny lives only a stone’s throw away.”\n\nI heard sand scraping at the bottom of the dinghy. We had arrived at a pristine white beach, adorned by a towering rock with a curving staircase carved into it.\n\n“Follow me!” Barnacle shouted as he pulled the dinghy onto the sand. We climbed the worn stone stairs and gazed down upon a breathtaking tropical island, lush in green palm trees and foliage. Sandy beaches lined the shore, dotted with the colorful towels and umbrellas of festive beach-goers, and a dazzling crystal clear waterfall sparkled in the sunlight.\n\n“Welcome to the island farm!” Barnacle clapped me on the shoulder. “Johnny is sure to have some extra fruit for us! Let’s go find him!”\n\nI held my breath nervously as we crossed a rickety wooden bridge and wandered down the island’s one stone path to a little farm nestled in the tropical wilderness. Along the way, I had to dodge at least two mischievous lemurs with a fervent desire to steal my hat!\n\nWe came upon a tan young man with long dreadlocks lying in a hammock next to a pretty brunette in a white doctor’s coat. Laughter and music floated over from a bustling bar not far away.\n\n“Johnny! Vicky!” Barnacle cried. “I can’t believe what you’ve done to this place. Your beach bar has really taken off, and your oranges are bigger than ever! I don’t suppose you have some to spare?”\n\n“Dad!” Johnny jumped out of his hammock and slung his guitar over his shoulder. “You finally made it out here! Have you met my girlfriend Vicky yet? She’s a vet!”\n\nVicky flashed us a beautiful smile. “You guys look thirsty! Would you like an Orange Fizz? Or how about a Summer Slush? That one really rakes in the seashells!”\n\n“Just some water for us two old salts!” Barnacle said. “We don’t have time to talk right now, Johnny. Our boat sank, and we need some supplies — not to mention a ship — so we can sail north to bring home your sister, Eva.”\n\nJohnny’s relaxed grin disappeared. “Of course! Anything to help. You can have all the oranges, coconuts, and peanuts that you want, Dad. I’ve even got a spare map! But I’m afraid I can’t help you with a boat. We need ours for when the monsoon hits. But old Oleg Fisher keeps a few extra trawlers docked here. Maybe you can ask him. Just make sure you hurry — the next monsoon is on its way, and it’ll wipe out the entire farm!”",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn008_copy": "The doctor arrived at once and hurried to Matilda’s side. He placed his small stethoscope on her chest and listened carefully. The deep frown of concern that crossed his normally jolly face gave me a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach.\n\n“I’m afraid Matilda has suffered a terrible shock,” the doctor said as he clasped my hand in his own. “Her heart is very weak at the moment. If she is exposed to any more excitement or confusion, it could kill her. Is there anything you can do to put her mind at ease?”\n\nI nodded sternly. “I can fix this,” I promised him.\n\n“But you have no boat!” Rita cried.\n\n“No, but I know somebody who does.” I threw open the door. “Where is Barnacle?”\n\n“Already here, brother!” A deep, familiar voice called from around the corner. “I came as soon as I heard the news.”\n\nWhen I caught sight of that big, rust-colored beard again, every repressed emotion from the last 10 years came rushing back. There was love and compassion, yes, but that was followed by an overpowering rush of anger, and most of all, a deep feeling of betrayal. I would have rather swum in a pool of stinging jellyfish than have spent any time with my traitor brother, but I knew I had no choice. This wasn’t about me; it was about my family.\n\n“Barnacle, I have to bring Eva home. I need your ship. Will you help me?” I demanded.\n\n“Of course, brother. We will bring her home together!” He fished the boat keys out of his pocket and dropped them in my palm. “Go raise the sails. I’ll grab supplies.” \n\nThat’s just like Barnacle, I thought to myself. Always playing the hero when he’s the one who got us into this mess in the first place. My mood grew dark, almost as dark as the black clouds accumulating on the horizon.\n\nI found Barnacle’s boat without an issue — it was a spitting image of mine, but the quality couldn’t even come close. I had half a mind to hoist the sails and leave Barnacle far behind, but something made me stay put. Even if I dreaded the idea of days stranded on a boat with Barnacle, I knew that I needed his help if I wanted to get Eva back before Matilda woke up.\n\nBarnacle appeared not long after, his arms laden with milk, eggs, and boxes of exotic fruit. I helped him without a word. He returned the silence. As we raised the anchor and prepared the rigging, the tension between us grew so thick that you could have cut it with a knife. Good thing neither one of us had one!\n\nThe storm brewing in the distance only put us more on edge. We bickered about who would steer the boat first. After a few minutes of “colorful” name calling, we agreed to simply flip a friendship penny instead. Barnacle won, and I huffed and puffed my way below deck for a quick nap to help me calm my nerves.\n\nI woke to the sound of great waves crashing against the hull. The vessel twisted and lurched as massive thunder cracked above. I jumped out of my bunk and, balancing myself between the walls of the tiny berth, maneuvered my way up to deck.\n\n“Ahoy, there!” Barnacle called over the pouring rain and gusts of wind. “Too bumpy for you, landlubber?”\n\n“What, this little drizzle? I’m here to take my shift!” But just as I tried to take the helm, a great wave crashed over the ship and slammed me against the railing hard enough to rattle my teeth.\n\n“You’d better get back below deck, dear brother! This kind of weather is only for real sailors!” Barnacle’s laugh rose high above the whistling winds.\n\nThat was the last straw. I couldn’t take it anymore! Too many years of lies, secrecy, and betrayal. I felt the rage of 1000 sea storms breaking loose inside me. But just as I raised my fists, a tremendous bolt of lightning cracked through the ship’s mast, leaving only a smoking hole in its wake — a smoking hole that was now rapidly filling up with seawater.",
  "CoopSmugglerYarn012_copy": "I turned the little boat upside down in a frantic search for the missing map. Without it, we could be lost at sea for months. Barnacle, Eva, and Nils helped me look, but luck was not on our side. As dusk settled in, I finally spied a tiny slip of paper clinging stubbornly to the bottom of a small, purple tentacle.\n\n“Miss Tentacle!” I shouted and grabbed for the paper. She quickly popped it into her mouth.\n\n“She must have eaten the entire thing!” Barnacle picked her up and flipped her over, desperate to find any last traces of the map stuck to her feelers. She wriggled out of his hands and scooted across the deck.\n\n“What are we going to do now?” Eva burst into tears. Nils put an arm around her and tried to comfort her.\n\n“We’ll figure something out,” he said reassuringly. “Whether it’s reenacting the lives of our ancestors or saving endangered animals, we always find a way.”\n\nEva smiled up at him through her tears. All of a sudden she jumped to her feet.\n\n“What are those strange lights?” She peered into the darkness. “They’re so bright. They must be coming from land!”\n\nBarnacle set course for this ring of blinking lights, which appeared to be hovering in mid-air. They guided us through the night and early into the next morning. I must have dozed off because the next thing I remember is being jerked awake by a loud cry of “Land ahoy!”\n\nI couldn’t believe my eyes: we were back! You couldn’t mistake the rusty old fishing pole, the light at the end of the pier, and my favorite: the odor of fresh dung! Nils, Eva, Barnacle, and I hugged each other in joy.\n\nWe set off to the farm academy as fast as our legs would carry us, Eva leading the way. She burst through the front doors of the academy. “Mom!” she shouted and ran over to Matilda’s cot. “Mom, wake up!”\n\nMatilda’s pale face shone like the moon in the weak dawn light. Her eyes were closed - I prayed that she was only asleep.\n\nMatilda’s eyelids slowly fluttered open, and she saw Eva kneeling beside her. “My darling daughter,” she whispered weakly. “You’re okay!”\n\n“I’m sorry I left, Mom. And look! I met Yarnacle … er, Dad.” A look of uncertainty crossed Eva’s face and she looked at Barnacle and me.\n\n“Matilda,” Barnacle stepped forward. “I’m so sorry for everything I did. I wanted to help, but in the end, I just made everything worse.” Barnacle stared at his hands. “How could you ever forgive me?”\n\n“Sweet Barnacle,” Matilda motioned for him to come closer. “Of course I forgive you. Family always comes first — and you did right by this one.” She grasped his hand in her own. “You will always belong here.”\n\nShe looked at me next and smiled. “I knew you would come back for me, Yarnacle.” She raised her arms. “Help me up, darling. I feel better already.” I lifted her into a sitting position and straightened her pillow behind her.\n\n“I’ll never leave your side again,” I promised. I turned to Barnacle. “Brother, take my ship. It’s your turn to see the world!”\n\nHis face broke into a wide grin and he clapped me on the back.\n\nWe were so busy celebrating Matilda’s returning health and our hopes for a better future that we didn’t notice Nils and Eva slip away. He took her hand and led her to the cooperative tree, the place where he first saw her weaving a homemade cotton bracelet.\n\nNils traced his finger over the spot where they had carved their initials into the bark. He pulled Eva close to him. “Eva, I couldn’t bear the thought of another moment without you. You are the woman who has made me into the man I am today. I love everything about you, and I want to live every day of this beautiful life with you by my side.” He bent down on one knee. “Will you marry me?”\n\nEva’s hands flew to her heart and tears sprang to her eyes. She pulled Nils back to his feet. “Of course! Of course!” she exclaimed and pulled him in for a big kiss.\n\nThose two had the most beautiful wedding Big Farm has ever seen. Millions of turquoise ribbons streamed down the walls of the library, pooling at the bottom like a serenity pond. The fountain was home to a dozen koi fish swimming and splashing playfully. Roses and violet blossoms lined every path and balcony, their rich fragrances wafting through the air.\n\nBarnacle and I were given the privilege of escorting Eva down the aisle, and she was the most beautiful blushing bride I have ever laid eyes on. But the best part of the night was after the ceremony, when Matilda and I snuck over to the wedding altar, just the two of us.\n\nI took her hands in mine and looked into her brilliant green eyes. “Matilda,” I whispered, my throat tight with emotion. “I promise to love you forever — for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do us part.” I leaned in and kissed her tenderly on the lips. “You will always be my darling.”\n\nAnd I’ve kept that promise ever since, dear reader. Doubt the facts of my story if you will, but if there is anything that always was true and always will be true, it’s that my love is real — my love for Eva, my love for Matilda, and most of all my love for this beautiful town, Big Farm.",

  "Xmas2016_storyBookChapt18_copy": "Lester concentrated hard until he could picture the scene the young ghost described for him.\n He was alone on his farm, which was looking even more run down than usual. There were no crops in the fields and no animals in the stables. A cold wind blew over the land, and in the distance, he could see Matilda MacMuffin carrying a basket full of food back to her farm. \n “Matilda, I don't suppose you could spare some of that delicious looking food for me?” he asked.\n Matilda looked back at Lester and shook her head. “I'm sorry, Lester, but not this time. This year we could do without you bah-humbugging the joy out of Christmas.”\n Lester opened his eyes with a gasp. He was in his room with the ghost and her turtle once more. \n “I never thought I would see the day when Matilda wouldn't donate some food! She’s one of the most generous people I know. Am I really such an old curmudgeon?”\n “There is still time to…”\n “Make amends, yes I know,” interrupted Lester, suddenly full of enthusiasm. “I will start right away!”",
  "Xmas2016_storyBookChapt6_copy": "Spooked by the events of his ghostly encounter, Lester struggled to find peace in his slumber. \n“Ghosts? Humbug! There's no such thing. I'm just being an old fool.”\nBut no matter how much he tried to convince himself that it was all in his imagination, the thought of the eerie warning continued to linger in the back of his mind. \nJust as he was managing to drift off, the clock on the wall struck midnight and a bright light, followed by a puff of smoke filled the room. From the smoke emerged a pale figure.\n “Lester, I am the Ghost of, erm, oh, what was it … ah yes, Christmas Past … I think,” rambled the spirit, coughing and waving his arms to clear the smoke. \n Lester examined the figure that stood before him. “You look oddly familiar, Ghost. Have we met?”\n “What? Oh, no, no. I'm the Ghost of Christmas Past, and I have come to take you on a trip back in time. Now, close your eyes and your journey will begin…”",
  "Xmas2016_storyBookChapt16_copy": "Lester knew there was no point trying to fall asleep tonight. He had one more visitor left to welcome and he was becoming increasingly certain that these visits weren't mere dreams. \n He waited patiently in his bed for the clock on the wall to strike midnight and his room to fill with light and smoke one last time. \nSoon enough, midnight arrived and from the smoke emerged a much smaller figure than Lester had anticipated. He couldn't be sure, but through the smoke it looked as though the ghost was holding a turtle.\n “Aloha!” said the spirit. \n“Are you the final ghost?&quot;\n “I am here to show you your Christmases yet to come.”\n&quot;Are you holding a turtle?&quot;\n&quot;Yes, her name is Shelly! I mean... are ready to go on your final journey?&quot;\n “Yes. Let’s just get this over with.”\n “Good. Now, just lay back and close your eyes….”",

That should put an end to these silly dreams once and for all!”\n Wearing his favorite pyjamas, he soon fell into a sound sleep, a sleep that wasn't disturbed until the clock on the wall struck midnight and his room was once more filled with light and smoke.\n “Oh no! Not again! Another infernal dream!”\n “This is no dream, I'm afraid. I am the Ghost of Christmas Present, and I have some really exciting gossip to share with you!”\n “Wait a minute…I know that voice…”\n “No you don't! Now, come with me and I will show you what this year's Christmas has in store for you should you continue with your selfish ways...” \nThe smoke cleared and Rita ... I mean, the Ghost of Christmas Present approached the bed where Lester lay. She looked at his pyjamas. “You better grab your jacket, it's a bit chilly out there!”",
  "Xmas2016_storyBookChapt22_copy": "Lester was better than his word. He prepared a Christmas feast the likes no one had seen before; and to the twins, who were smiling once more, he gave them the first dibs on the biggest turkey he could find. Some of the guests laughed to see the sudden alteration in him, and he could barely believe it himself. &quot;Was it all real?&quot; he found himself thinking.\nAs the afternoon wore on more guests arrived, and though space was limited, a seat at the table was found for all. Even little Lana’s turtle, who looked strangely familiar to Lester, was given some leaves to chew on.\nSo many people arrived, that food was running scarce, and though nobody seemed to mind, Lester worried that some of his new friends would go hungry.",

A chilly breeze tickled his cheeks as the window across the room burst open, but the old man didn’t seem to notice as he continued to snore away. \nHis attention was soon roused, however, when he heard what sounded like the clip clopping of hooves on his wooden floor. He peered up over the back of the armchair and saw… no, it couldn’t be…. a ghost!?\n“Wh-wh--who are you? What are you doing in my house?”\n“I have come to tell you that you'll be visited by three ghosts before Christmas arrives. It's about time you were shown the true meaning of Christmas.”\n“Bah,” said Lester, “Humbug! There's no such thing as ghosts. I'm just seeing things. Yes, I bet it's just that cheese from the farm next door. I knew that stuff was no good.” \n “This is no dream, Lester. Remember, three ghosts before Christmas day arrives...”\nAnd with a puff of smoke, the ghost was gone.",

  "Xmas2016_storyBookChapt13_copy": "The ghost led Lester to Benny Buddler’s house, where the two of them quietly crouched outside a window. Inside, Benny was hosting a spectacular Christmas dinner with everybody from the farm in attendance. Everybody, that is, except Lester. \n  “Well, everyone looks happy enough. I don't know what all the fuss is about,” said Lester, shivering slightly from the cold.\n “Look more closely,” replied the ghost.\n Lester peered through the window and examined the scene once again, only this time he noticed that the twins, normally so wide-eyed and full of life, were not their usual smiling selves. \n “They were carol singing and spreading joy around the farms,” said the ghost, “but someone slammed the door in their faces and they haven't opened their mouths since.”\n Lester watched as the other members of the farm tried to console the young boys, but their faces showed no signs of festivity. \n“What will become of them?” Lester asked the ghost. “Has their Christmas been ruined by my coldness?”\n “It's never too late to make amends,” replied the ghost. &quot;But I must leave you now, I have big deadline tomorrow...eh, I mean, I have spooky things to attend to!&quot;",
  "Xmas2016_storyBookStoryPrologue_copy": "Why, hello there! It’s me, Rudolph. Santa has given us reindeer a few weeks holiday because we have worked so hard for him this year, so I thought I would come and visit all my friends on the farm. I had such a wonderful time here on my last trip that I simply had to come back!\n\nI would love to hang around for a while and catch-up, but I have promised to take the twins carol singing and it’s already getting dark. Oh, before I go, I have brought you some gifts for letting me stay.",

The more horses on the meadow, the easier it is to find a suitable partner.\nAlternatively, you can do more activities with your horse instead of breeding immediately. In this case, you will have to charge the love meter again to be able to breed, however you get the chance to have a better clock hand selection. You can charge the love meter up to 27 times. Each time, one cell of the wheel will be activated, independent of the horse attributes. This way you can improve your results. Additionally, you will get genes for each section selected by the clock hands during a breeding opportunity. This way it becomes easier to get a high number of genes after each round, whereby the total number of genes per section is 100. The third option for finding a suitable partner is to ask Rose McLundy to catch a suitable wild horse form the prairie behind the horse ranch.",

But first you have to distribute the genes between the corresponding attributes/breeding effects. \nJust use the sliders to increase or decrease the chance of getting the corresponding attribute or breeding effect improvement. If neither horse has a specific breeding effect, then that breeding effect is disabled, meaning that the foal cannot get it. When you are finished, you have to click the 'Breed' button below the sliders. The newly bred horse will be available immediately.",

Each section is divided into 4 cells. The more cells that are active (per section), the more your horse and its breeding partner resemble each other, and the better the result will be. For each matching clock hand, you will get up to 50 genes, depending on the similarity of the attributes or breeding effects. If both horses (yours and the breeding partner) have the same type of attributes or breeding effects, these attributes or breeding effects will get double the genes. The higher the number of genes, the higher the chance of producing a better foal.",

Once you have collected a certain amount of hearts and have filled up the love meter, you can start to breed.\nThe number of hearts you can get for each horse activity depends on the order in which you complete the activities. Some activities are more useful at night, others during day. Use the activity history to find out what the best combination of activities is.",

Mrs. Claus has everybody on a low-sugar diet, which hasn’t exactly made Santa go “ho-ho-ho”, the other reindeer are miserable because of the lack of snow this year, and even Santa’s work horses have long faces. The atmosphere isn’t exactly jolly at the moment, I can tell you!\n\nThe biggest problem, however, is that we’re a little behind schedule with the toy making. It hasn’t helped that all the elves have fallen ill! At first we thought they were just suffering from low-elf esteem, hehehe, but unfortunately it seems like something more than that. We took them to see a gnome-opath, but he couldn’t find what was wrong. These are worrying times indeed. \n\nIt’s always wonderful catching-up with you, farmer, but I have a lot of people to talk to and very little time. Before I go, I have brought you some gifts for letting me stay on your lovely farm. Here, take this.",
  "Xmas2017_storyBookChapt8_copy": "The professor has done an amazing job with the toy maker… I think… I don’t really understand a lot of the words on his blueprints! Now I need to ask Steve Screwdriver if he can build the machine based on these designs. After all, he was able rebuild Santa’s sleigh after I took it out for a roy ride last year… but that’s a whole other story! \n\nI visited Vicky again today to see how the elves are doing. She says there has been no improvement. I’m sure they’ll be fine, but we really need to find a way to help Santa’s little subordinate clauses. \n\nOh, before I go, the professor told me you helped him put the machine together. I have brought a gift to thank you for your assistance!",
  "Xmas2017_storyBookChapt5_copy": "Those twins sure do have terrific imaginations! I have never seen such a variety of toy designs. They’ve thought of everyone. They even designed a toy to cheer up Santa’s work horses - they call it a Pony Sleigh Station, whatever that means. The problem I have now is finding a way to bring these designs to life. I wonder if Professor James can help.\n\nI went to visit elves this morning with some music to lift their spirits. We listened to Sled Zeppelin, Bonbon Jovi, Amy Mulled-Winehouse - all their favourites, but they didn’t even raise a smile. Not even Elfis Presley did the trick, and he always gets them dancing. The poor little guys must really be sick. I wonder what is wrong with them? Hopefully Vicky can find a cure soon.\n\nOh, before I go, I have another gift for you!",

Can you help?",

  "Quest_ThemeAsian_11_reward": "Good thing I'm not allergic to bee stings! Unless dropping things is an allergic reaction. Thanks for helping me collect them up!",
  "Quest_ThemeAsian_11_copy": "I hear that tea ceremonies are important where Daniel is going. I thought it was 'tee rituals', but it turns out they don't really like golf so much.",
